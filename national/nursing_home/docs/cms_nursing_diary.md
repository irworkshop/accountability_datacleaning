## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and
give journalists, policy professionals, activists, and the public at
large a simple way to search across huge volumes of public data about
people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking
of each dataset row as a transaction. For each transaction there should
be (at least) 3 variables:

1.  All **parties** to a transaction
2.  The **date** of the transaction
3.  The **amount** of money involved

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following
objectives:

1.  How many records are in the database?
2.  Check for duplicates
3.  Check ranges
4.  Is there anything blank or missing?
5.  Check for consistency issues
6.  Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
7.  Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
8.  Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize,
analyze, and communicate these results. The `pacman` package will
facilitate their installation and attachment.

The IRW’s `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub.
This package contains functions custom made to help facilitate the
processing of campaign finance data.

``` r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  readxl, # read excel
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  knitr, # knit documents
  vroom, # read files fast
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which
lives as a sub-directory of the more general, language-agnostic
[`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning "TAP repo")
GitHub repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio
projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects "Rproj")
feature and should be run as such. The project also uses the dynamic
`here::here()` tool for file paths relative to *your* machine.

``` r
# where does this document knit?
here::here()
#> [1] "/Users/yanqixu/code/accountability_datacleaning/R_campfin"
```

## Data

The master flat file is obtained from the
[Medicare.gov](https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/Data/About.html).
The data is as current as March 16,
2020.

``` r
raw_dir <- dir_create(here("nursing_home","data"))
```

``` r
landing_url <- 'https://data.medicare.gov/views/bg9k-emty/files/6ef81c64-2ebd-4ece-93af-8e462427939a?content_type=&filename=NursingHomeCompare_Revised_Flatfiles.zip'

zip_path <- path(raw_dir,str_extract(landing_url,"(?<=filename\\=).+"))

if (!all_files_new(raw_dir)) {
   download.file(url = landing_url, destfile = zip_path)
}
```

``` r
zip_contents <- 
  unzip(zip_path, list = TRUE) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  clean_names()

zip_data <- str_subset(zip_contents$name, "csv")

zip_others <- setdiff(zip_contents$name, zip_data)

if (not(all(file_exists(path(raw_dir, zip_data))))) {
  unzip(
    zipfile = zip_path,
    files = zip_data,
    exdir = raw_dir
  )
}

if (not(all(file_exists(path(docs, zip_others))))) {
  unzip(
    zipfile = zip_path,
    files = zip_others,
    exdir = docs
  )
}
```

The abbreiviation information is stored in
`NHC_DataDictionary_SNFQRP.pdf` and the record layouts are contained in
`DataMedicareGov_MetadataAllTabs_v23.xlsx`.

First, we will read the ownership data. We can also view the record
layout from the `Ownership` sheet
`DataMedicareGov_MetadataAllTabs_v23.xlsx`.

``` r
owner <- read_csv(str_subset(path(raw_dir, zip_data),"Owner.+")) %>% clean_names()
```

``` r
owner_dict <- read_xlsx(str_subset(path(docs, zip_others),"DataMedicareGov"),
                        sheet = "Ownership")

kable(owner_dict)
```

#> 12 filedate         <date>     0 0
```

We’ll flag the records without any owner name (0 entries).

``` r
owner <- owner %>% flag_na(owner_name)
```

### Duplicates

We can see there’s no duplicate entry.

``` r
owner <- flag_dupes(owner, dplyr::everything())
```

## Wrangle

To improve the searchability of the database, we will perform some
consistent, confident string normalization. For geographic variables
like city names and ZIP codes, the corresponding `campfin::normal_*()`
functions are taylor made to facilitate this process. \#\#\# Date From
the record layout, we can see that we can clean the
`association_date`with either an `NA` or an acutal date without the word
“wince”.

``` r
owner <- owner %>% 
  mutate(association_date_clean = na_if(association_date, "No Date Provided") %>% 
           str_remove("since\\s") %>% 
           as.Date("%m/%d/%Y"))
```

### Percentage

We can also clean the `owner_percentage` field.

``` r
owner <- owner %>% 
  mutate(owner_percentage_clean = owner_percentage %>% 
           na_if("NOT APPLICABLE") %>% 
           na_if("NO PERCENTAGE PROVIDED") %>% 
           str_remove("%") %>% 
           as.numeric())
```

### Address

For the street `addresss` variable, the `campfin::normal_address()`
function will force consistence case, remove punctuation, and
abbreviation official USPS suffixes.

``` r
owner <- owner %>% 
    mutate(address_norm = normal_address(address,abbs = usps_street,
      na_rep = TRUE))
```

### ZIP

For ZIP codes, the `campfin::normal_zip()` function will attempt to
create valied *five* digit codes by removing the ZIP+4 suffix and
returning leading zeroes dropped by other programs like Microsoft Excel.

``` r
prop_in(owner$zip, valid_zip, na.rm = T)
#> [1] 0.9186872

owner <- owner %>% 
    mutate(zip5 = normal_zip(zip, na_rep = T))

prop_in(owner$zip5, valid_zip, na.rm = T)
#> [1] 0.9996987
```

### State

The two digit state abbreviations are all valid.

``` r
prop_in(owner$state, valid_state, na.rm = T)
#> [1] 1
```

### City

Cities are the most difficult geographic variable to normalize, simply
due to the wide variety of valid cities and formats. \#\#\#\# Normal

The `campfin::normal_city()` function is a good ownerart, again
converting case, removing punctuation, but *expanding* USPS
abbreviations. We can also remove `invalid_city` values.

``` r
owner <- owner %>% 
      mutate(city_norm = normal_city(city,abbs = usps_city,
      states = usps_state,
      na = invalid_city,
      na_rep = TRUE))

prop_in(owner$city_norm, valid_city, na.rm = T)
#> [1] 0.9735063
```

#### Swap

We can further improve normalization by comparing our normalized value
against the *expected* value for that record’s state abbreviation and
ZIP code. If the normalized value is either an abbreviation for or very
similar to the expected value, we can confidently swap those two.

``` r
owner <- owner %>% 
  rename(city_raw = city) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state" = "state",
      "zip5" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    match_abb = is_abbrev(city_norm, city_match),
    match_dist = str_dist(city_norm, city_match),
    city_swap = if_else(
      condition = !is.na(match_dist) & match_abb | match_dist == 1,
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(
    -city_match,
    -match_dist,
    -match_abb
  )
```

After the two normalization steps, the percentage of valid cities is at
100%. \#\#\#\# Progress

| stage      | prop\_in | n\_distinct | prop\_na | n\_out | n\_diff |
| :--------- | -------: | ----------: | -------: | -----: | ------: |
| city\_raw  |    0.989 |        5264 |    0.000 |   1764 |     113 |
| city\_norm |    0.992 |        5248 |    0.000 |   1270 |      87 |
| city\_swap |    0.996 |        5239 |    0.001 |    640 |      55 |

You can see how the percentage of valid values increased with each
stage.

![](../plots/progress_bar-1.png)<!-- -->

More importantly, the number of distinct values decreased each stage. We
were able to confidently change many distinct invalid values to their
valid equivalent.

``` r
progress %>% 
  select(
    stage, 
    all = n_distinct,
    bad = n_diff
  ) %>% 
  mutate(good = all - bad) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("good", "bad")) %>% 
  mutate(name = name == "good") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stage, y = value)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", direction = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "Nursing Home Compare Ownership City Normalization Progress",
    subtitle = "Distinct values, valid and invalid",
    x = "stage",
    y = "Percent Valid",
    fill = "Valid"
  )
```
