|Multiple Record    |text         |When "Multiple Record" is indicated this means that there is more than one record for the same employee.  This can be the result of that employee changing jobs, being employed in multiple temporary jobs, or moving from one job type to another (e.g., moving from a temporary job to a classified job).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |multiple_record    |       14|text           |      31024388|
