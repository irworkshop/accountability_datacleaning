## Data

This is an analysis of Paycheck Protection Program loans in Mississippi.

On Dec. 1, 2020 the Small Business Administration was ordered by the
court to release more detailed data on loans made through the [Paycheck
Protection
Program](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program),
a major facet of the 2020 CARES Act to provide stimulus funding during
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This detailed release came after the SBA
initially refused to publish any database, then released only partial
data on the largest loan recipients. The full database now contains all
recipient names, addresses, and exact loan amounts.

[According to the
SBA](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20Borrower%20Information%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf),
PPP loans are forgiven as long as:

1.  The loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs, and most mortgage
    interest, rent, and utility costs over the 8 week period after the
    loan is made.
2.  Employee and compensation levels are maintained.

[The SBA clarifies key
aspects](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/PPP%20Loan%20Data%20-%20Key%20Aspects%2012-01-20%20-%20Final.pdf)
of the PPP, namely how the money is distributed and what information is
actually contained in the data.

> #### PPP Is A Delegated Loan Making Process
> 
> PPP loans are not made by SBA. PPP loans are made by lending
> institutions and then guaranteed by SBA. Accordingly, borrowers apply
> to lenders and self-certify that they are eligible for PPP loans. The
> self-certification includes a good faith certification that the
> borrower has economic need requiring the loan and that the borrower
> has applied the affiliation rules and is a small business. The lender
> then reviews the borrower’s application, and if all the paperwork is
> in order, approves the loan and submits it to SBA…

> #### Cancelled Loans Do Not Appear In The PPP Loan Data
> 
> The public PPP data includes only active loans. Loans that were
> cancelled for any reason are not included in the public data release.

## Preparation

We read the normalized PPP data from the IRW S3 server.

``` r
ppp_dir <- here("us", "covid", "ppp")
ppp_file <- path(ppp_dir, "data", "clean", "sba_ppp_full.csv")
```

``` r
if (!file_exists(ppp_file)) {
  save_object(
    object = "csv/sba_ppp_full.csv",
    bucket = "publicaccountability",
    file = ppp_file
  )
}
```

``` r
ppp <- vroom(
  file = ppp_file,
  col_types = cols(
    naics_code = col_character(),
    zip = col_character()
  )
)
```

We added additional variables to identify which records are in
Mississippi.

``` r
ppp <- ppp %>% 
  mutate(
    is_ms = !is.na(state) & state == "MS",
    ms_lab = ifelse(is_ms, "Miss.", "Other")
  )
```

And then created a separate table of just Mississippi loans.

``` r
ms_ppp <- filter(ppp, is_ms)
ms2x <- bind_rows(
  "United States" = ppp,
  "Mississippi" = ms_ppp,
  .id = "ms_lab2"
)
```

## Explore

Mississippi has 48,010 loans with 22 columns. In total, $3,193,019,738
was distributed to Mississippi businesses.

Mississippi accounts for 0.9% of the total PPP loans, and 0.6% of the
total amount disbursed. This is close to the 0.9% of the U.S. population
that lives in the state.

## Jobs

We examined the number of *jobs* reportedly retained. These numbers were
self reported and a significant amount of applications reported zero
jobs or omitted a number altogether, although the percent of loans
missing job saved was smaller in Mississippi than the country at large.

    #> # A tibble: 2 x 3
    #>   ms_lab2       no_job zero_jobs
    #>   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>
    #> 1 Mississippi   0.0239    0.0817
    #> 2 United States 0.0652    0.124

These loans, with missing or invalid jobs reported, do not appear to be
tied to the time the loan was approved and probably isn’t related to
confusion.

![](../plots/jobs_missing_time-1.png)<!-- -->

The loans missing job data seem to be tied to the lending bank. In
Mississippi, **100%** of loans from Wells Fargo were missing job
information while **0%** of those from PriorityOne Bank were.

The following two tables list the top ten banks with the greatest and
least proportion of their loans missing job information (sorted by most
loans given).

We ignored missing data in our breakdown of reported jobs.

Most loans did go to small businesses saving less than **25** jobs. This
was true in both Mississippi and the rest of the country.

``` r
ms2x %>% 
  group_by(ms_lab2) %>% 
  summarise(small_jobs = mean(jobs < 25, na.rm = TRUE))
#> # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   ms_lab2       small_jobs

The loan amounts for companies that retained 500 jobs vary widely from
$2,253 to $10,000,000.

We looked at the amount of money compared to the number of jobs. Some
businesses in Mississippi received hundreds of thousands to save one or
two jobs. Other received a few thousand to save more than 100 jobs.

These are the businesses that received the most and least money per job
retained:

loans, which is not allowed under the PPP rules.

This could be in line with [earlier
reporting](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ppp-loan-program-accidentally-paid-some-small-business-owners-twice-n1224061)
that some small businesses had received multiple PPP loans:

> The issue stems from the hectic early weeks of the program, when
> funding ran out quickly and borrowers were not hearing back from their
> banks, industry sources told NBC News. Although businesses must
> certify they are only applying for one loan, some small-business
> owners applied at more than one bank to ensure they could secure a
> financial lifeline amid the economic shutdown.

Some of these duplicate loans appear to be similar in value, but none of
them are exactly the same and some are from the same bank. A separate
text file with these loans to duplicate businesses has been created.

### Duplicate Addresses

There are thousands of loans issued to duplicate addresses. In some
cases, the addresses may be for the headquarters of an organization. For
example, the Catholic Diocese of Jackson is headquartered at 237 E Amite
ST, where **51** other church locations are also incorporated (the 10
largest of those loans are listed below).

Other cases may be worth digging into.

It seems common in the data for separate franchises or subsidiaries to
receive their own loans. Dozens of BUMPER’S DRIVE-IN restaurants all
incorporated at the same address but operating in different locations
received their own loans.

This address in Gulfport is also the location of incorporation for nine
Domino’s Pizza franchises, *three* of which reportedly retained the
maximum 500 jobs and took a combined $10.2 million in PPP loans, which
exceeds the maximum loan amount for any single business entity. All of
these loans were issued by the same bank and all but one were issued on
the same day. Weirdly enough, most of these businesses seem to cover
regions outside Mississippi.

It’s worth noting that businesses with more than 500 employees not
*necessarily* ineligible for PPP loans, according to [this SBA FAQ
sheet](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Final%20PPP%20FAQs%20%28December%209%202020%29-508.pdf).
Businesses only have to attest eligibility.

> **Question:** Are small business concerns (as defined in section 3 of
> the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632) required to have 500 or fewer
> employees to be eligible borrowers in the PPP?
> 
> **Answer:** No. Small business concerns can be eligible borrowers even
> if they have more than 500 employees, as long as they satisfy the
> existing statutory and regulatory definition of a “small business
> concern” under section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632. A
> business can qualify if it meets the SBA employee-based or
> revenue-based size standard corresponding to its primary industry. Go
> to \<www.sba.gov/size\> for the industry size standards…
> 
> A business that qualifies as a small business concern under section 3
> of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, may truthfully attest to its
> eligibility for PPP loans on the Borrower Application Form, unless
> otherwise ineligible.

## Business Type

There are 18 different kinds of business types.

The PPP was ostensibly designed to help small businesses, but most loans
nationwide were given to Corporations. In Mississippi, a greater
percentage of loans were given to LLC’s and sole proprietorships.

![](../plots/biz_type-1.png)<!-- -->

The distribution of loan amounts by business type is roughly similar
between loans to businesses in Mississippi and the country at large. The
only major discrepancies come from the business types with very few
loans in the state.

## Business Industry

![](../plots/industry_count_bar-1.png)<!-- -->

![](../plots/industry_mean_bar-1.png)<!-- -->

## Business Ownership

There are four variables in the data describing the ownership of the
businesses.

1.  The race and ethnicity
2.  Gender
3.  Veteran status
4.  Non-profit status

Most loans did not report this information.

``` r
ms2x %>% 
  group_by(ms_lab2) %>% 
  summarise(
    no_race = mean(race == "Unanswered", na.rm = TRUE),
    no_gender = mean(gender == "Unanswered", na.rm = TRUE),
    no_vet = mean(veteran == "Unanswered", na.rm = TRUE)
  )
#> # A tibble: 2 x 4
#>   ms_lab2       no_race no_gender no_vet
#>   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>

#> 2 United States   0.896     0.786  0.854
```

The degree of missing race data, for example, does not seem correlated
with a particular type of business.

``` r
ms_ppp %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    no_race = mean(race == "Unanswered", na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
