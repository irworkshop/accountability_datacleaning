## Project


The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give journalists, policy
professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple way to search across huge volumes of
public data about people and organizations.


Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each dataset row as a
transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3 variables:


1. All **parties** to a transaction
2. The **date** of the transaction
3. The **amount** of money involved


## Objectives


This document describes the process used to complete the following objectives:


1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
1. Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
1. Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction


## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze, and communicate
these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their installation and attachment.

```{r p_load, message=FALSE, dfrning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_current_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  stringdist, # levenshtein value
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  tidytext, # string analysis
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  knitr, # knit documents
  glue, # combine strings
  scales, #format strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs, # search storage 
  vroom, #read deliminated files
  readxl #read excel files
)
```

```{r fix_fun, echo=FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
# fix conflict
here <- here::here
print_all <- function(df) df %>% print(n = nrow(.)) 
```
This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a sub-directory of
the more general, language-agnostic [`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][01] GitHub
repository.


The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][02] feature and should be run as such. The
project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file paths relative to _your_ machine.


```{r where_here, collapse=TRUE}
# where dfs this document knit?
here::here()
```

## Download
Set the download directory first.
```{r raw_dir}
# create a directory for the raw data
raw_dir_lb <- here("ia", "lobbying", "data", "raw", "lobbyists")
raw_dir_cl <- here("ia", "lobbying", "data", "raw", "clients")
dir_create(raw_dir_lb)
dir_create(raw_dir_cl)
```
The [Iowa Legislature] [03] makes available lobbyist information through a database for each session. First, we need to download all the lobbyists registration records associated with each session and combine them into a single preadsheet. 

[03]: https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/searchLobby?type=lobbyist
[05]: https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ico/chapter/68B.pdf#page=24

```{r lobbyings, eval = FALSE}

lb_url_1 <- glue("https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/searchLobby?action=generateExcel&ga={83:88}")

lb_url_2 <- glue("&type=lobbyist&personID=&clientID=&name=&session={1:2}")

ia_lobby_lb_urls <- NULL

for (i in lb_url_1) {
  for (j in lb_url_2){
    if (str_detect(i, "88") & str_detect(j, "session=2")){
      break}
    ia_lobby_lb_urls = c(ia_lobby_lb_urls,str_c(i,j))
  }
}

if (!all_files_new(raw_dir_lb)) {
  for (url in ia_lobby_lb_urls) {
    download.file(
      url = url,
      destfile = glue("{raw_dir_lb}/ia_lobby_by_lobbyists_{str_extract_all(url, '[[:digit:]]') %>% unlist() %>% str_c(collapse = '')}.xlsx")
    )
  }
}

cl_url_1 <- glue("https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/searchLobby?action=generateExcel&ga={83:88}")

cl_url_2 <- glue("&type=client&personID=&clientID=&name=&session={1:2}")

ia_lobby_cl_urls <- NULL

for (i in cl_url_1) {
  for (j in cl_url_2){
    if (str_detect(i, "88") & str_detect(j, "session=2")){
      break}
    ia_lobby_cl_urls = c(ia_lobby_cl_urls,str_c(i,j))
  }
}

if (!all_files_new(raw_dir_cl)) {
  for (url in ia_lobby_cl_urls) {
    download.file(
      url = url,
      destfile = glue("{raw_dir_cl}/ia_lobby_by_clients_{str_extract_all(url, '[[:digit:]]') %>% unlist() %>% str_c(collapse = '')}.xlsx")
    )
  }
}
```

Then, we'll merge each dataset into a master dataset. Note that there is no date or year field in the individual databases, and we will need to create such fields in the master file retaining the legislative period information. 
[Iowa Code Ann. § 68B.36.][05] regulates lobbyists and clients reporting.   
> All lobbyists shall, on or before the day their lobbying activity begins, register by
electronically filing a lobbyist’s registration statement...Registration shall be valid from the date of registration until the end of the calendar
year.
On or before July 31 of each year, a lobbyist’s client shall electronically file with the
general assembly a report that contains information on all salaries, fees, retainers, and
reimbursement of expenses paid by the lobbyist’s client to the lobbyist for lobbying purposes
during the preceding twelve calendar months, concluding on June 30 of each year.

## Clients

### Reading
```{r read client files}
ia_lobby_cl <- dir_ls(raw_dir_cl, glob = "*.xlsx")  %>% 
  map(read_xlsx) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "file") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  # create a column with the original file info
  mutate(session_1 = as.numeric(str_sub(basename(file), start = -8, end = -7)),
          session_2 = as.numeric(str_sub(basename(file), start = -6, end = -6))) %>% 
  mutate_if(is_character, str_to_upper) %>% 
  rename(address_raw = address) %>% 
  na_if("NULL")
```

### Wrangling

Since all the lobbyists were jumbled together, we turn the lobbyists column into a vector, and then use `unnest_longer()` to unnest all the elements in the vector to keep each in individual row. 
```{r unnest}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  mutate(lobbyist = str_split(lobbyists, pattern = ", ")) %>% 
  unnest_longer(lobbyist)
```

### Duplicates

We'll use the `flag_dupes()` function to see if there are records identical to one another and flag the duplicates. A new variable `dupe_flag` will be created.

```{r flag dupe}
ia_lobby_cl <- flag_dupes(ia_lobby_cl, dplyr::everything())
```


##### Year 
```{r add year}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  mutate(year = 1842 + session_1 *2 + session_2)
```

#### Address
Separate the address, city, state and zip columns.
```{r separate columns}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  separate(address_raw,  into = c("address", "state_zip"), 
           #the separator is written in regex, to use the city as the separator for address and state_zip
           sep = ";.+,\\s", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  separate(state_zip, into = c("state", "zip"), sep = "\\s", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(city_raw = str_match(address_raw, ";\\s([^;]+),\\s")[,2]) %>% 
  select(-state_zip)
```

```{r normal address, echo=FALSE}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  mutate(address_clean = normal_address(address = address,
      abbs = usps_city,
      na_rep = TRUE))
```

#### ZIP 
```{r client normal zip}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_norm = normal_zip(
      zip = zip,
      na_rep = TRUE)
  )
```

#### State

Some of the state fields were not filled even though the city and zipcodes were given. We'll join the dataframe with the zipcodes dataframe to make safe guesses.

```{r clients clean state}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  mutate(state_clean = normal_state(state, na = c("","NA", "NULL"))) 
```


#### City

Now we turn on zen mode. 

###### Prep
```{r prep_city, collapse = TRUE}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% mutate(city_norm = normal_city(city = city_raw,
                                            abbs = usps_city,
                                            states = c(valid_state),
                                            na = invalid_city,
                                            na_rep = TRUE))
n_distinct(ia_lobby_cl$city_raw)
n_distinct(ia_lobby_cl$city_norm)

prop_in(ia_lobby_cl$city_raw, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
prop_in(ia_lobby_cl$city_norm, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
```
###### State interpolation

Some of the state fields were not filled even though the city and zipcodes were given. After normalizing city and state, we'll join the dataframe with the zipcodes dataframe to make safe guesses.

```{r clients state interpolation}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  left_join(zipcodes, by = c("zip_norm" = "zip", "city_norm" = "city")) %>% 
  mutate(state_clean= if_else(
    condition = is.na(state_clean),
    true = state.y,
    false = state_clean
  )) %>% 
  select(-state.y) %>% 
  rename(state = state.x)
```

###### Swap
Then, we will compare these normalized `city_norm` values to the _expected_ city value for the client's ZIP code. If the [levenshtein distance][09] is less than 3, we can confidently swap these
two values.

[09]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

```{r swap_city}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    match_dist = stringdist(city_norm, city_match),
city_swap = if_else(condition = is.na(city_match) == FALSE,
                        if_else(
      condition = match_dist <= 2,
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    ),
      false = city_norm
  ))

prop_in(ia_lobby_cl$city_swap, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
```

This is a very fast way to increase the valid proportion to
`r percent(prop_in(ia_lobby_cl$city_swap, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE))` and reduce the number of distinct
_invalid_ values from `r length(setdiff(ia_lobby_cl$city_norm, valid_city))` to only
`r length(setdiff(ia_lobby_cl$city_swap, valid_city))`

#### Missing

```{r count_na}
ia_lobby_cl  %>% col_stats(count_na)
```
Few values are missing from the lobbyists database.


### Lobbyists

We'll join the lobbyists data back to the client database to add the address.

#### Reading
```{r read data by lobbyists}
ia_lobby_lb <- dir_ls(raw_dir_lb, glob = "*.xlsx")  %>% 
  map(read_xlsx) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "file") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  # create a column with the original file info
  mutate(session_1 = as.numeric(str_sub(basename(file), start = -8, end = -7)),
          session_2 = as.numeric(str_sub(basename(file), start = -6, end = -6))) %>% 
  mutate_if(is_character, str_to_upper) %>% 
  rename(address_raw = address) %>% 
  na_if("NULL")
```

#### Duplicates

We'll use the `flag_dupes` function to see if there are records identical to one another and flag the duplicates. A new variable `dupe_flag` will be created.

```{r lobbyists flag dupe}
ia_lobby_lb <- flag_dupes(ia_lobby_lb, dplyr::everything())
```

#### Wrangling

##### Year 
```{r lobbyists add year}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  mutate(year = 1842 + session_1 *2 + session_2)
```

##### Address
Separate the address, city, state and zip columns.
```{r lobbyists separate columns}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  separate(address_raw,  into = c("address", "state_zip"), 
           #the separator is written in regex, to use the city as the separator for address and state_zip
           sep = ";.+,\\s", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  separate(state_zip, into = c("state", "zip"), sep = "\\s", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(city_raw = str_match(address_raw, ";\\s([^;]+),\\s")[,2]) %>% 
  select(-state_zip)
```

```{r lobbyists normal address, echo=FALSE}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  mutate(address_clean = normal_address(address = address,
      abbs = usps_city,
      na_rep = TRUE))
```
##### ZIP 
```{r lobbyists normal zip}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_norm = normal_zip(
      zip = zip,
      na_rep = TRUE)
  )
```

#### State

```{r lobbyists clean state}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  mutate(state_normal = normal_state(state, na = c("","NA", "NULL"))) 
```


#### City

Same thing as bove.

###### Prep

```{r lobbyists prep_city, collapse = TRUE}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% mutate(city_norm = normal_city(city = city_raw,
                                            abbs = usps_city,
                                            states = c(valid_state),
                                            na = invalid_city,
                                            na_rep = TRUE))
n_distinct(ia_lobby_lb$city_raw)
n_distinct(ia_lobby_lb$city_norm)

prop_in(ia_lobby_lb$city_raw, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
prop_in(ia_lobby_lb$city_norm, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r lobbyists state interpolation}
ia_cities <- zipcodes %>% filter(state == "IA")

ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  left_join(zipcodes, by = c("zip_norm" = "zip", "city_norm" = "city")) %>% 
  mutate(state_normal = if_else(
    condition = is.na(state_normal),
    true = state.y,
    false = state_normal)) %>% 
  select(-state.y) %>% 
  rename(state = state.x)

ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% mutate(state_clean = if_else(condition = is.na(state_normal) & city_norm %in% ia_cities$city,
              true = "IA",
              false = state_normal))

```


###### Swap
Then, we will compare these normalized `city_norm` values to the _expected_ city value for that
lobbyist's ZIP code. If the [levenshtein distance][09] is less than 3, we can confidently swap these
two values.

[09]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

```{r lobbyists swap_city}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    match_dist = stringdist(city_norm, city_match),
city_swap = if_else(condition = is.na(city_match) == FALSE,
                        if_else(
      condition = match_dist <= 2,
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    ),
      false = city_norm
  )) %>% 
  rename(city_clean = city_swap)

prop_in(ia_lobby_lb$city_clean, valid_city, na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Missing

```{r lobbyists count_na}
ia_lobby_lb  %>% col_stats(count_na)
```
Few values are missing from the lobbyists database.


## Join
In order to get lobbyists' addresses, we will join by lobbyists names from these two dataframes. But first, we'll need to clean up the two data tables a bit by getting rid of some iterative columns that we created and join them by common fields. 
```{r prepare lobbyists fields}
ia_lobby_lb <- ia_lobby_lb %>% 
  select(-c(city_norm,
            city_match,
            file,
            state_normal,
            clients, 
            match_dist))

colnames(ia_lobby_lb) <- str_c("lb_", colnames(ia_lobby_lb))
```

```{r prepare clients fields}
ia_lobby_cl <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  rename(city_clean = city_swap) %>% 
  select(-c(city_norm,
            file,
            city_match,
            match_dist))
colnames(ia_lobby_cl) <- str_c("cl_", colnames(ia_lobby_cl))
```

To avoid confusion and extraneous records, we only join the non-duplicate rows. 

```{r join clients and lobbyists}
ia_lobby <- ia_lobby_cl %>% 
  rename(lobbyist = cl_lobbyist) %>% 
  filter(!cl_dupe_flag) %>% 
  left_join(ia_lobby_lb %>% filter(!lb_dupe_flag), by = c("lobbyist" = "lb_name",
                                                          "cl_session_1" = "lb_session_1",
                                                          "cl_session_2" = "lb_session_2",
                                                          "cl_year" = "lb_year")) %>% 
  select(-c(cl_dupe_flag, lb_dupe_flag, 
            ends_with("_raw"))) %>% 
  rename(client = cl_client,
         lb_zip5 = lb_zip_norm,
         cl_zip5 = cl_zip_norm) 

ia_lobby %>% col_stats(count_na)
```

## Export

```{r write_clean}
clean_dir <- here("ia", "lobbying", "data", "processed")
dir_create(clean_dir)
ia_lobby %>% 
  na_if("NULL") %>% 
  write_csv(
    path = glue("{clean_dir}/ia_lobby_reg_clean.csv"),
    na = ""
  )
```
