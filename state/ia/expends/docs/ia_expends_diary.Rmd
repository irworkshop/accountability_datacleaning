## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give journalists, policy
professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple way to search across huge volumes of
public data about people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each dataset row as a
transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3 variables:

1. All **parties** to a transaction
2. The **date** of the transaction
3. The **amount** of money involved

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following objectives:

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
1. Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
1. Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze, and communicate
these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their installation and attachment.

The IRW's `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub. This package contains
functions custom made to help facilitate the processing of campaign finance data.

```{r p_load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
pacman::p_load_gh("VerbalExpressions/RVerbalExpressions")
pacman::p_load_current_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  stringdist, # levenshtein value
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  tidytext, # text mining tools
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  zipcode, # clean & databse
  batman, # parse logicals
  RSocrata, # query soda api
  refinr, # cluster & merge
  scales, #format strings
  rvest, # scrape website
  skimr, # summary stats
  vroom, # quickly read
  glue, # combine strings
  gluedown, #markdown
  here, # locate storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a sub-directory of
the more general, language-agnostic [`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][01] GitHub
repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][02] feature and should be run as such. The
project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file paths relative to _your_ machine.

```{r where_here}
# where does this document knit?
here::here()

## Data


[Data][03] is obtained from the Iowa Ethics & Campaign Disclosure Board's open data portal.

> This dataset contains information on expenditures made by state-wide, legislative or local
candidate committees, state PACs, county central committees, state parties, and state and local
ballot issue committees in Iowa. Data is available beginning in 2003 for all reports filed
electronically, and some paper filed reports. Data is provided through reports submitted by
candidate committees, state political committees, federal/out-of-state political committees, county
central committees, ballot issue committees and organizations making contributions or independent
expenditures. Quality of the data provided in the dataset is dependent upon the accuracy of the
data reported electronically.

## Import

The data can be directly read using `RSocrata::read.socrata()`.

```{r read_socrata}
#ia <- as_tibble(read.socrata("https://data.iowa.gov/resource/3adi-mht4.json"))
raw_dir <- here("state","ia","expends","data","raw")
ia <- read_csv(dir_ls(raw_dir)) %>% clean_names()
ia$expenditure_amount <- as.double(ia$expenditure_amount)
ia$date <- as.Date(ia$date,format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```

## Explore

```{r glimpse}
head(ia)
tail(ia)
glimpse(sample_frac(ia))
```


### Missing

The variables range in their degree of missing values. There are `r campfin::count_na(ia$amount)` missing
values for variables like `transaction_id`, `date`, or `amount`.

```{r count_na}
col_stats(ia, count_na)
```

While there are `r count_na(ia$committee_nm)` missing values for `committee_nm`, 
`r percent(mean(is.na(ia$organization_nm)))` of `organization_nm` is missing. However,
`r percent(mean(!is.na(ia$last_nm)))` of records _do_ have a `last_nm` value. We will flag any
record without either an `organization_nm` or `last_nm`.

```{r flag_na, collapse=TRUE}
ia <- ia %>% 
  flag_na(committee_name, receiving_organization_name, date, expenditure_amount)

sum(ia$na_flag)
```

### Distinct

The variables also range in their degree of distinctness. We can see that the `transaction_id` is
`r percent(n_distinct(ia$transaction_id)/nrow(ia))` distinct and can be used to identify a unique
expenditure.

```{r n_distinct}
col_stats(ia, n_distinct)
```

### Duplicates

Ignoring the supposedly unique `transaction_id` variable, there are a number of completely
duplicated records than can be flagged with a new `dupe_flag` variable with `campfin::flag_dupes`.

```{r get_dupes, collapse=TRUE}
ia <- flag_dupes(ia, everything())
sum(ia$dupe_flag)
mean(ia$dupe_flag)
```

### Ranges

For continuous variables, we should check the range and distribution of values.

#### Amounts

The `amount` value ranges from `r dollar(min(ia$amount))` to `r dollar(max(ia$amount))` with 
`r sum(ia$amount <= 0)` values less than or equal to `r dollar(0)` (which typically indicates a
correction). The mean expenditure is has a value of `r dollar(mean(ia$amount))`, while the median
is only `r dollar(median(ia$amount))`.

```{r anmount_range}
summary(ia$expenditure_amount)
sum(ia$expenditure_amount <= 0)
percent(mean(ia$expenditure_amount <= 0))
```

```{r amount_hist, echo=FALSE}
ia %>% 
  ggplot(aes(expenditure_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Dark2")[3]) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(1 %o% 10^(0:6)),
    trans = "log10",
    labels = dollar
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Iowa Expenditure Amounts",
    caption = "Source: IA ECDB",
    x = "Amount",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

We can view the smallest and largest expenditures to see if these are potentially typos.

```{r glimpse_minmax_amount}
glimpse(ia %>% filter(expenditure_amount == min(expenditure_amount)))
glimpse(ia %>% filter(expenditure_amount == max(expenditure_amount)))
```

#### Dates

The ranges for `date` seem reasonable. There are `r sum(ia$date > today())` dates beyond 
`r today()`.

```{r date_ranges, collapse=TRUE}
min(ia$date)
max(ia$date)
sum(ia$date > today())
```

We can create a `year` variable to better explore and search the data, using `lubridate::year()`

```{r add_year}
ia <- ia %>% 
  mutate(
    year = year(date),
    on_year = is_even(year)
  )
```

```{r count_minmax_year, collapse=TRUE}
sum(ia$year == min(ia$year))
sum(ia$year == max(ia$year))
```

```{r year_count_bar, echo=FALSE}
ia %>% 
  count(on_year, year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = on_year)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(
    type = "qual",
    palette = "Dark2",
    guide = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Iowa Expenditure Counts per Year",
    caption = "Source: IA ECDB",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

```{r amount_year_bar, echo=FALSE}
ia %>% 
  group_by(year, on_year) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(expenditure_amount)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = on_year)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(
    type = "qual",
    palette = "Dark2",
    guide = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Iowa Expenditure Mean Amount per Year",
    caption = "Source: IA ECDB",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

```{r amount_month_line}
ia %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(on_year, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(expenditure_amount)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = on_year), size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = month.abb, breaks = 1:12) +
  scale_color_brewer(
    type = "qual",
    palette = "Dark2"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Iowa Expenditure Amount by Month",
    caption = "Source: IA ECDB",
    color = "Election Year",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Amount"
  )
```

## Wrangle

```{r norm_address}
ia <- ia %>% 
  unite(
    col = address_comb,
    starts_with("address_line"),
    remove = FALSE,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    address_norm = normal_address(
      address = address_comb,
      abbs = usps_street,
      na = c("", "NA"),
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

```{r view_address}
ia %>% 
  select(
    starts_with("address")
  ) %>% 
  sample_frac()
```

ia <- ia %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_norm = normal_zip(
      zip = zip,
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

```{r zip_progress}
progress_table(
  ia$zip,
  ia$zip_norm,
  compare = valid_zip
)
```

### State

```{r state_norm}
ia <- ia %>% 
  mutate(
    state_norm = normal_state(
      state = str_replace(state, "AI", "IA"),
      na_rep = TRUE,
      valid = NULL
    )
  )
```

```{r state_progress}
progress_table(
  ia$state,
  ia$state_norm,
  compare = valid_state
)
```

### City

### Normalize

```{r city_norm}
ia <- ia %>% 
  mutate(
    city_norm = normal_city(
      city = city %>% str_replace("DesMoines", "Des Moines"),
      abbs = usps_city,
      states = c("IA", "IOWA", "DC"),
      na = c("", "NA"),
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

```{r city_count_bad}
ia %>% 
  filter(city_norm %out% valid_city) %>% 
  count(state_norm, city, city_norm, sort = TRUE)
```

### Swap

```{r city_swap}
ia <- ia %>% 
  rename(city_raw = city) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state_norm" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    match_abb = is_abbrev(city_norm, city_match),
    match_dist = str_dist(city_norm, city_match),
    city_swap = if_else(
      condition = match_dist == 1 | match_abb,
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    )
  )
```

```{r city_progress}
progress_table(
  str_to_upper(ia$city_raw),
  ia$city_norm,
  ia$city_swap,
  compare = valid_city
)
```
