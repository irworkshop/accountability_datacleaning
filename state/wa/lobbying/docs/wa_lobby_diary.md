## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and
give journalists, policy professionals, activists, and the public at
large a simple way to search across huge volumes of public data about
people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking
of each dataset row as a transaction. For each transaction there should
be (at least) 3 variables:

1.  All **parties** to a transaction
2.  The **date** of the transaction
3.  The **amount** of money involved

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following
objectives:

1.  How many records are in the database?
2.  Check for duplicates
3.  Check ranges
4.  Is there anything blank or missing?
5.  Check for consistency issues
6.  Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
7.  Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
8.  Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize,
analyze, and communicate these results. The `pacman` package will
facilitate their installation and attachment.

The IRW’s `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub.
This package contains functions custom made to help facilitate the
processing of campaign finance data.

``` r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irwokshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  stringdist, # levenshtein value
  RSelenium, # remote browser
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  knitr, # knit documents
  vroom, # read files fast
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which
lives as a sub-directory of the more general, language-agnostic
[`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning "TAP repo")
GitHub repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio
projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects "Rproj")
feature and should be run as such. The project also uses the dynamic
`here::here()` tool for file paths relative to *your* machine.

``` r

## Data

Data is obtained from the [Washington Public Disclosure
Commission](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/) (PDC). The dataset is found on the
[Washington state OpenData portal](https://data.wa.gov).

### Records

Each observation represents the relationship between a lobbying agent,
their employer, and the firm for which they lobby. Each lobbyist can
have multiple records, each with another client or employer.

> This dataset contains information about the agents employed by a
> lobbying firm and the employers they ultimately lobby for.
> 
> See the Lobbyist Agent Employers dataset for each individual lobbyist
> agent to employer relationship.
> 
> A lobbyist/firm registers with the PDC, not individual agents
> (employees) of that firm. The PDC provides this data as a way to see
> the individuals that lobby for a firm and all the employers of that
> firm. This does not indicate that a particular agent necessarily
> lobbied for a particular employer, merely that the agent’s firm
> lobbied for that employer.
> 
> This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of
> records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect
> information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the
> purpose of record verification.

### Variables

  - `id`: An auto-generated unique identifier representing a
    relationship between a Lobbyist firm, an Agent, and an Employer for
    a given year.
  - `filer_id`: The unique id assigned to the lobbyist/firm that employs
    this agent.
  - `lobbyist_firm_name`: The lobbyist firm who employs the agent.
  - `lobbyist_phone`: The phone number associated with the lobbyist
    firm.
  - `lobbyist_email`: The email address associated with this lobbyist
    firm.
  - `lobbyist_address`: The address of the lobbyist firm.
  - `employers`: The list of all employers that this agent’s firm
    lobbied for in the given year.
  - `agent_name`: The registered name of the agent.
  - `agent_bio`: The biographical data submitted by the agent.
  - `agent_pic_url`: A link to the agents picture.
  - `employment_year`: The year the agent lobbied for this employer
  - `lobbyist_firm_url`: A link to the registration information
    submitted by the lobbyist.

## Import

We can import the file directly from the OpenData portal using
`readr::read_csv()`.

``` r
wa <- read_csv(
  file = "https://data.wa.gov/api/views/bp5b-jrti/rows.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    .default = col_character(),
    employment_year = col_integer()
  )
)
```

### Separate Address

Using regular expression and our `zipcodes` database, we can extract the
ZIP code, state abbreviation, and city name from the end of the
`lobbyist_address` variable.

``` r
wa <- wa %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_sep = str_extract(lobbyist_address, "\\d+(?:-\\d{4})?$"),
    state_sep = str_extract(lobbyist_address, "[:alpha:]+(?=\\s+\\d+(?:-\\d{4})?$)"),
    other_sep = lobbyist_address %>%
      str_remove("[:alpha:]+(?=\\s+\\d+(?:-\\d{4})?$)") %>% 
      str_remove("\\d+(?:-\\d{4})?$") %>% 
      str_trim("right"),
    city_sep = NA_character_
  )
```

To extact the cities from the end of this string, we’ll have to expand
our `zipcodes` database with other common city names.

``` r
zips2 <- zipcodes %>% 
  add_row(city = "DES MOINES", state = "WA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "TUKWILA", state = "WA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "SEATAC", state = "WA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "TIGARD", state = "OR") %>% 
  add_row(city = "MILL CREEK", state = "WA") %>%
  add_row(city = "BRIDGEVIEW COURT", state = "IN") %>% 
  add_row(city = "LAKE TAPPS", state = "WA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "LAKE FOREST PARK", state = "WA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "GOLD RIVER", state = "CA") %>% 
  add_row(city = "SEATAC", state = "WA")
```

Then, for each row, we attempt to extract every city name (for that
row’s state) from the end of the address string sans ZIP code and
state.

``` r
for (row in seq_along(wa$other_sep)) {
  state <- wa$state_sep[row]
  for (city in unique(zips2$city[zips2$state == state])) {
    wa$city_sep[row] <- str_extract(
      string = wa$other_sep[row],
      pattern = glue("\\b{city}\\b")
    )
    if(!is.na(wa$city_sep[row])) break
  }
}
```

For those rows where a state was not extracted, we can simply take the
last word from the string.

``` r
wa$city_sep[which(is.na(wa$city_sep))] <- word(wa$other_sep[which(is.na(wa$city_sep))], -1)
```

Then, we can remove this `city_sep` from the `other_sep` vector to leave
only the street address.

``` r
wa <- wa %>% 
  mutate(
    address_sep = other_sep %>% 
      str_remove(city_sep) %>% 
      str_trim("right")
  )
```

### Normalize Address

We can normalize the address with `campfin::normal_address()` to reduce
inconsistencies and expand USPS abbreviations.

``` r
wa <- wa %>% 
  mutate(
    address_norm = normal_address(
        address = address_sep,
        add_abbs = usps_street,
        na_rep = TRUE
      )
  )
```

    #> # A tibble: 1,096 x 2
    #>    address_sep                   address_norm                    
    #>    <chr>                         <chr>

    #> # … with 1,086 more rows

### Normalize ZIP

We can create normalize, valid 5-digit ZIP codes using
`campfin::normal_zip()`.

``` r
wa <- wa %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_norm = normal_zip(
      zip = zip_sep,
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

``` r
progress_table(
  wa$zip_sep,
  wa$zip_norm,
  compare = valid_zip
)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 6
#>   stage    prop_in n_distinct prop_na n_out n_diff
#>   <chr>      <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1 zip_sep    0.883        370       0   504    104
#> 2 zip_norm   0.999        279       0     6      2
```

### Normalize State

The `state_sep` variable is 100% valid.

``` r
prop_in(wa$state_sep, valid_state)
#> [1] 1
```

### Normal City

``` r
wa <- wa %>% 
  mutate(
    city_norm = normal_city(
      city = city_sep,
      geo_abbs = usps_city,
      na = invalid_city
    )
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state_sep" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    match_dist = str_dist(city_norm, city_match),
    match_abb = is_abbrev(city_norm, city_match),
    city_swap = if_else(
      condition = match_abb | match_dist == 1,
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    )
  )
```

``` r
progress_table(
  wa$city_sep,
  wa$city_norm,
  wa$city_swap,
  compare = valid_city
)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 6

#> 3 city_swap   0.980        145 0.00370    86      9
```

``` r
wa %>% 
  filter(city_swap %out% valid_city) %>% 
  count(city_swap, sort = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 9 x 2
