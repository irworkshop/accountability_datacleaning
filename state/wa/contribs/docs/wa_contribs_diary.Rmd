## Objectives

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called ZIP5
1. Create a YEAR field from the transaction date
1. For campaign donation data, make sure there is both a donor AND recipient

## Data

### About

> This dataset contains cash and in-kind contributions, (including unpaid loans) made to Washington
State Candidates and Political Committees for the last 10 years as reported to the PDC on forms C3,
C4, Schedule C and their electronic filing equivalents. It does not include loans which have been
paid or forgiven, pledges or any expenditures.
> 
> For candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily
the year the contribution was reported. For political committees, the number of years is determined
by the calendar year of the reporting period.
>
> Candidates and political committees choosing to file under "mini reporting" are not included in
this dataset. See WAC 390-16-105 for information regarding eligibility.
>
> This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described
herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the
original reports for the purpose of record verification.
>
> Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW
42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information political finance
disclosure requirements.
>
> CONDITION OF RELEASE: This publication constitutes a list of individuals prepared by the
Washington State Public Disclosure Commission and may not be used for commercial purposes. This
list is provided on the condition and with the understanding that the persons receiving it agree to
this statutorily imposed limitation on its use. See RCW 42.56.070(9) and AGO 1975 No. 15.

### Variables

The Public Disclosure Commission [provides definitions][03] for each of the variables in the data
set:

* `id`: Corresponds to a single record. Uniquely identifies a single row When combined with the
origin value.
* `report_number`: Used for tracking the individual form. Unique to the report it represents.
* `origin`: The form, schedule or section where the record was reported.
* `filier_id`: The unique id assigned to a candidate or political committee. Consistent across
election years.
* `type`: Indicates if this record is for a candidate or a political committee
* `first_name`: First name, as reported by the filer. Potentially inconsistent.
* `last_name`: Last name or full name of a filing entity that is registered under one name.

* `for_or_against`: Ballot initiative committees either supports or opposes
* `jurisdiction`: The political jurisdiction associated with the office of a candidate
* `election_year`: Election year for candidates and single election committees. Reporting year for
continuing committees.
* `amount`: The amount of the cash or in-kind contribution (or adjustment).
* `cash_or_in_kind`: What kind of contribution, if known.
* `receipt_date`: The date that the contribution was received.
* `description`: The reported description of the transaction. This field does not apply to cash
contributions
* `primary_general`: Candidates must specify whether a contribution is designated for the primary
or the general election.
* `code`: Type of entity that made the contribution.
* `contributor_name`:	The name of the individual _or_ organization making the contribution as
reported (where total >$25).
* `contributor_address`: The street address of the individual or organization making the
contribution.
* `contributor_city`: The city of the individual or organization making the contribution.
* `contributor_state`: The state of the individual or organization making the contribution.
* `contributor_zip`: The US zip code of the individual or organization making the contribution.
* `contributor_occupation`: The occupation of the (individual) contributor (where total >$100).
* `contributor_employer_name`: The name of the contributor's employer.
* `contributor_employer_city`: City of the contributor's employer.
* `contributor_employer_state`: State of the contributor's employer.
* `url`: A link to a PDF version of the original report as it was filed to the PDC.

## Packages

This data set will be collected, explored, and saved using the free and open R packages below.

```{r libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,
  lubridate, 
  RSocrata,
  magrittr, 
  janitor, 
  zipcode, 
  here,
  fs
)
```

## Read

The source file is updated, daily so reproducing findings precisely is unlikely. Code here has been
generalized as much as possible. The data in this document was retrieved the day it was created
(see above).

If _today's_ file exists in the project directory, read it into R; otherwise, retrieve the file
directly from the Washington State website. This is done using `readr::read_csv()`

The `receipt_date` strings are converted from their original format (MM/DD/YYYY) to ISO-8601 format
(YYYY-MM-DD) as to be handled as date objects in R. The contribution `amount` values are read as
doubles. All other variables are handled as character strings.

```{r read_csv, collapse=TRUE}
# create path to file
dir_create(here("wa", "contribs", "data", "raw"))
wa_file <- here(
  "wa", "contribs", "data", "raw", 
  "Contributions_to_Candidates_and_Political_Committees.csv"
)

download.file(
  url = "https://data.wa.gov/api/views/kv7h-kjye/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD",
  destfile = wa_file
)

wa <- read_csv(
  file = wa_file,
  col_types = cols(
    .default = col_character(),
    election_year = col_double(),
    amount = col_double(),
    receipt_date = col_date("%m/%d/%Y")
  )
)

file.exists(wa_file)
```

## Explore

There are `r nrow(wa)` records of `r length(wa)` variables. There are no duplicate rows.
However, without the unique `id` variable, there are `nrow(wa) - nrow(distinct(select(wa, -id)))` 
rows with repeated information.

```{r dims}
glimpse(wa)
nrow(distinct(wa)) == nrow(wa)
wa %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow() %>% 
  subtract(nrow(wa))
```

Variables range in their degree of distinctness. For example, There are only 10 distinct value of
`origin` and 97 for `ballot_number`; however, there are understandably nearly half a million
distinct values for `contributor_location` and even more for `contributor_name`.

```{r n_distinct}
wa %>% 
  map(n_distinct) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_distinct") %>% 
  mutate(prop_distinct = round(n_distinct / nrow(wa), 4)) %>% 
  print(n = length(wa))
```

Variables also range in their degree of missing values. Key variables like `report_number` or
`code` have 0 missing values, while others like `first_name` or `office` are missing over half
(likely PAC/Corp. contributions and issue contributions respectively).

```{r}
count_na <- function(v) sum(is.na(v))
wa %>% map(count_na) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_na") %>% 
  mutate(prop_na = n_na / nrow(wa)) %>% 
  print(n = length(wa))
```

We can use `janitor::tablyl()` and `base::summary()` to explore the least distinct and continuous
variables.

```{r}
wa %>% tabyl(origin) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(type) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(party) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(for_or_against) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(election_year)

wa %>% tabyl(cash_or_in_kind) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(cash_or_in_kind) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(primary_general) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>%  tabyl(code) %>% arrange(desc(n))

wa %>% tabyl(contributor_state) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r log_amount_plot, fig.width=10, fig.align="center", fig.keep="none"}
wa %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = amount)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar, 
                breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 100000, 1000000)) +
  facet_wrap(~cash_or_in_kind, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "Logarithmic Histogram of Contribution Amounts",
       x = "Dollars Contributed",
       y = "Number of Contributions")
```

There are `r sum(wa$amount < 0)` records with `amount` values less than zero, which seem to
indicate corrections or refunds.

The median negative amount is only \$100, but `r sum(wa$amount < -10000)` are less than $10,000 and
one is a correction of \$2.5 million. That report can be found at the URL below.

```{r summary_amount}
summary(wa$amount)
summary(wa$amount[wa$amount < 0])
wa$url[wa$amount == min(wa$amount)]
```

There seems to be a number of broken date strings in the `receipt_date` variable. The earliest and
latest dates do not make sense. The earliest date was listed on a form from 2007, but records the
receiving date as 1900.

```{r date_dims}
min(wa$receipt_date, na.rm = TRUE)
max(wa$receipt_date, na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(wa$receipt_date))
```

There should only be reports for the last 10 years, but over 100,000 are more than 12 years old.
There are 15 records with dates from before the year 2000. There are also 34 record with receipt
dates more than a year from today.

```{r n_weird_dates}
wa %>% 
  filter(receipt_date < "2000-01-01") %>%
  arrange(receipt_date) %>% 
  select(
    id, 
    receipt_date, 
    election_year, 
    contributor_name, 
    amount, filer_name
  )

wa %>% 
  filter(receipt_date > today() + years(1)) %>%
  arrange(desc(receipt_date)) %>% 
  select(
    id, 
    receipt_date, 
    election_year, 
    contributor_name, 
    amount, filer_name
  )
```

Looking at the original report source for a few of them (found through the `url` value), we can see
normal looking contribution dates alongside the weird ones. Writing "06/06/14" as "06/06/41" is an
example of a likely error.

There are nearly 200 records with egregious dates older than 1990 or from the future. I will flag
these dates with a new `date_flag` logical variable.

```{r weird_dates}
wa <- wa %>% mutate(date_flag = receipt_date < "1990-01-01" | receipt_date > today())
```

## Clean

We can now clean the data to reach our objectives. All original columns and rows are preserved. New
cleaned columns are suffixed with `*_clean`.

### Mutate

Add new variables using `dplyr::mutate()` and string functions from: `zipcode`, `lubridate`, and
`stringr`.

```{r add_vars}
wa <- wa %>% 
  # create needed cols
  mutate(zip5_clean = clean.zipcodes(contributor_zip)) %>% 
  mutate(year_clean = year(receipt_date)) %>%
  # initialize other cols
  mutate(
    address_clean = str_remove(contributor_address, "[:punct:]"),
    city_clean    = contributor_city,
    state_clean   = contributor_state
  )
```

### ZIP Codes

After `zipcode::clean.zipcodes()` runs, there are still,
`r sum(nchar(wa$zip5_clean) < 5, na.rm = T)` ZIP codes less than 5 characters. We can make these
`NA` rather than try to figure them out. We can also make some common erroneous ZIPs `NA`.

```{r}
n_distinct(wa$contributor_zip)
n_distinct(wa$zip5_clean)
sum(nchar(wa$zip5_clean) < 5, na.rm = T)
unique(wa$zip5_clean[nchar(wa$zip5_clean) < 5 & !is.na(wa$zip5_clean)])
wa$zip5_clean[nchar(wa$zip5_clean) < 5 & !is.na(wa$zip5_clean)] <- NA
wa$zip5_clean <- wa$zip5_clean %>% na_if("00000|11111|99999")
```

### Sate Abbreviations

There are `r n_distinct(wa$contributor_state)` distinct state abbreviations in the
`contributor_state` variable.

```{r}
n_distinct(wa$contributor_state)
```

The `zipcode` package contains a useful list of zip codes and their accompanying states and cities.
This package has a list of state abbreviations that includes armed forces postal addresses and
American territories. We can add Canadian provinces to make it even more useful (compared to
`base::state.abb`).

```{r make_valid_abbs, collapse=TRUE}
data("zipcode")
zipcode <- 
  tribble(
    ~city,           ~state,
    "Toronto",       "ON",
    "Quebec City",   "QC",
    "Montreal",      "QC",
    "Halifax",       "NS",
    "Fredericton",   "NB",
    "Moncton",       "NB",
    "Winnipeg",      "MB",
    "Victoria",      "BC",
    "Vancouver",     "BC",
    "Surrey",        "BC",
    "Richmond",      "BC",
    "Charlottetown", "PE",
    "Regina",        "SK",
    "Saskatoon",     "SK",
    "Edmonton",      "AB",
    "Calgary",       "AB",
    "St. John's",    "NL") %>% 
  bind_rows(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(city = str_to_upper(city) %>% str_remove_all("[:punct:]")) %>% 
  arrange(zip)

valid_abbs   <- sort(unique(zipcode$state))
invalid_abbs <- setdiff(wa$contributor_state, valid_abbs)
```

From this list, we know there are `r length(valid_abbs)` valid abbreviations across the 50 states,
DC, territories, military bases, and Canadian provinces.

There are `r sum(!(na.omit(wa$contributor_state) %in% valid_abbs))` records with 
`r length(setdiff(wa$contributor_state, valid_abbs))` invalid abbreviations.

```{r see_invalid_abbs}
wa %>% 
  filter(!(contributor_state %in% valid_abbs)) %>% 
  group_by(contributor_state) %>% 
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

"ZZ" is used to represent contributions from foreign countries. Some Canadian contributions have
valid `contributor_state` values (e.g., "BC", "ON"). There are `r sum((na.omit(wa$contributor_state
== "ZZ")))` "ZZ" records with `r n_distinct(wa$contributor_city[wa$contributor_state == "ZZ"])`
distinct `contributor_city` values.

```{r see_zz_city}
wa %>%
  filter(contributor_state == "ZZ") %>% 
  pull(contributor_city) %>% 
  unique()
```

```{r fix_zz_state}
wa$state_clean[wa$contributor_state == "ZZ" & 
                 wa$contributor_city == "VANCOUVER BC" & 
                   !is.na(wa$contributor_state)] <- "BC"

wa$state_clean[wa$contributor_state == "ZZ" & 
                 wa$contributor_city == "RICHMOND, BC" & 
                   !is.na(wa$contributor_state)] <- "BC"

wa$state_clean[wa$contributor_state == "ZZ" & 
                 wa$contributor_city == "SURREY BC" & 
                   !is.na(wa$contributor_state)] <- "BC"
```

Once those "ZZ" values are made into Canadian abbreviations, we can make the rest of the "ZZ"
values `NA`.

```{r fix_xx_state}
wa$state_clean <- wa$state_clean %>% na_if("ZZ")
wa$state_clean <- wa$state_clean %>% na_if("XX") # also foreign
```

All the records with a `state_clean` value of `,` have a `contributor_city` value of "SEATTLE",
so we can make them all "WA".

```{r fix_comma_state}
if (
  wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean == ",") %>% 
  pull(contributor_city) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  equals("SEATTLE")
) {
  wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean == "," & !is.na(wa$state_clean)] <- "WA"
}
```

Most of the records with a `contributor_state` value of "RE" have "REQUESTED" in the fields as a
placeholder. We will have to make them `NA`. Two records can be fixed manually based on their
`contributor_city` value.

```{r fix_re_state}
wa %>% 
  filter(address_clean == "REQUESTED") %>%
  filter(state_clean == "RE") %>% 
  select(
    id,
    contributor_name,
    contributor_address,
    contributor_state,
    contributor_zip,
    amount,
    filer_name
  )

wa$state_clean[wa$address_clean == "REQUESTED" & wa$state_clean == "RE"] <- NA

wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean == "RE") %>% 
  pull(contributor_city) %>% 
  unique()

# if the city is REDMOND and state RE, make WA
wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean == "RE" & 
                 wa$city_clean == "REDMOND" & 
                  !is.na(wa$state_clean)] <- "WA"

# if the city is LAKE FOREST PARK and state RE, make WA
wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean == "RE" & 
                 wa$city_clean == "LAKE FOREST PARK" & 
                  !is.na(wa$state_clean)] <- "WA"

```

Many of the records with a `contributor_state` value of "OT" seem to be located in Australia, and
all of them appear to be from foreign countries. Perhaps "OT" is an abbreviation for "Overseas
Territory"? We can make these values `NA`.

```{r fix_ot_state}
wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean == "OT") %>% 
  select(
    contributor_name,
    contributor_address,
    contributor_city,
    contributor_state,
    contributor_zip,
    filer_name
  )

wa$state_clean %<>% na_if("OT")
```

There are 26 records with numeric state abbreviations. Using the `contributor_city` and
`contributor_zip` variables and comparing those in our `zipcode` table, we can see these should all
have state abbreviations of "WA."

```{r fix_digit_state}
if (
  wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean %>% str_detect("[\\d+]")) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = (zipcode %>% 
      select(city, zip, state) %>% 
      drop_na()), 
    by = c("zip5_clean" = "zip")) %>%
  pull(state) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  equals("WA")
) {
  wa$state_clean[str_detect(wa$state_clean, "[\\d+]") & !is.na(wa$state_clean)] <- "WA"
}
```

There are `r sum(wa$state_clean == "OL", na.rm = T)` records with a `contributor_state` value of
"OL." Each of these records has a `contributor_state` value of "OLYMPIA" and a `contributor_zip`
value in Washington. We can give all these records a `state_clean` value of "WA."

One is from Selfoss, a city in Iceland. The `contributor_name` value for that record has many
missing characters, as one from Iceland would. We will make that state record `NA`.

```{r fix_ol_state}
wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean == "OL") %>% 
  pull(city_clean) %>% 
  unique()

wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean == "OL"] <- "WA"
wa$state_clean[wa$city_clean == "SELFOSS"] <- NA
```

After fixing these most common `contributor_state` errors, there are a little over 100 records
still with invalid state abbreviations. Looking at the city names, most of these abbreviations
stand for other countries and can be made `NA`. We can fix records with `contributor_city` values
that look American.

```{r see_invalid_state_city}
sum(na.omit(wa$state_clean) %in% invalid_abbs)

wa %>% 
  filter(state_clean %in% invalid_abbs) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(state_clean)) %>% 
  pull(city_clean) %>% 
  unique()
```

There are over 50 records with a `contributor_city` value of "SEATTLE" and Washington state ZIP
codes with invalid `contributor_state` values. We can make these "WA".

```{r fix_seattle_state}
seattle_ids <- wa %>%
  filter(city_clean == "SEATTLE") %>% 
  filter(state_clean %in% invalid_abbs) %>% 
  select(
    id, 
    contributor_name,
    address_clean,
    city_clean,
    state_clean,
    zip5_clean,
    filer_name) %>% 
  left_join(
    (zipcode %>% select(city, zip, state) %>% drop_na()), 
    by = c("zip5_clean" = "zip", "city_clean" = "city")) %>% 
  pull(id)

wa$state_clean[wa$id %in% seattle_ids] <- "WA"
rm(seattle_ids)
```

This record should be placed in Washington, D.C.

```{r fix_di_state}
wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean == "DI" & 
                 wa$city_clean == "WASHINGTON" & 
                   wa$zip5_clean == "20016" & 
                     !is.na(wa$state_clean)] <- "DC"
```

Finally, we can make all remaining invalid abbreviations `NA`.

```{r make_invalid_na, collapse=TRUE}
n_distinct(wa$state_clean)
length(valid_abbs)
sum(na.omit(wa$state_clean) %in% invalid_abbs)
wa$state_clean[wa$state_clean %in% invalid_abbs] <- NA
```

This brings our total distinct abbreviations to `r n_distinct(wa$state_clean)`. There are records
from every state except for American Samoa, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

```{r final_diff, collapse=TRUE}
n_distinct(wa$state_clean)
setdiff(valid_abbs, sort(unique(wa$state_clean)))
```

### Clean City

#### New Method

The spelling of city names will be corrected using a lookup table available in the `data`
directory.

```{r}
wa_city_lookup <- read_csv("wa_contribs/data/wa_city_lookup.csv")

wa %>% 
  left_join(wa_city_lookup, by = c("city_clean" = "CITY_CLEAN")) %>% 
  select(-city_clean) %>% 
  rename(city_clean = CITY_CLEAN_JL)
```


#### Old Method

Cities are the most challenging. There are `r n_distinct(wa$contributor_city)` distinct values of
`contributor_city`. There are `r length(zipcode$city[zipcode$state == "WA"])` Washington state
cities in the fairly comprehensive `zipcode` list. Since only 5% of records are from outside the
state, there are clearly many misspelled `contributor_city` values.

```{r confirm_misspell}
n_distinct(wa$contributor_city)
wa %>% tabyl(state_clean) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

Looking at just values starting with "SEAT", we can see how many different ways people can misspell
their city.

```{r view_seat_bad}
unique(wa$city_clean[str_detect(wa$city_clean, "SEAT")])
```

There are `r length(unique(wa$city_clean[!(wa$city_clean %in% zipcode$city)]))` of 
`contributor_city` values not contained in the `zipcodes` data base; not all are misspellings, but
there are still too many to correct by hand.

```{r count_weird_city}
length(setdiff(wa$city_clean, zipcode$city))
```

I am going to create a separate table of spelling corrections. We can then join this table onto
the original data to create a new column of correct city names. The bulk of the work will be done
using key collision and ngram fingerprint algorithms from the open source tool Open Refine. These
algorithms are ported to R in the package `refinr`. These tools are able to correct most of the 
common errors, but I will be double checking the table and making changes in R.

There is a separate file in `wa_contribs/code/` which creates the lookup table needed to correct
spelling. That file has more detailed comments on the process. Below you can see some of the
changes made.

```{r source_refine}
source(here("wa_contribs", "code", "fix_wa_city.R"))
sample_n(city_fix_table, 10)
```

Join the original data set with the table of corrected city spellings. For every record, 
make `city_clean` either the original spelling or the corrected spelling.

```{r join_refine}
wa <- wa %>% 
  left_join(city_fix_table, by = c("zip5_clean", "city_clean", "state_clean")) %>% 
  mutate(city_clean = ifelse(is.na(city_fix), city_clean, city_fix)) %>% 
  select(-city_fix)
```

## Confirm

The key variables for this project are:

* `id` and `record_number` to identify the form
* `contributor_name` for who is giving money
* `amount` for how much was given
* `filer_name` for who it was given to

We need to ensure every row in the cleaned table contains that information.

```{r check_dupes}
wa %>% 
  # select for the important vars
  select(
    id, 
    report_number, 
    contributor_name, 
    amount, 
    filer_name) %>% 
  # drop any row with missing data
  drop_na() %>% 
  # count the rows
  nrow() %>% 
  # check if equal to total total
  subtract(nrow(wa))
```

The cleaned data set has 27 rows missing key information. Many of them are from a single auction,
held on April 29, 2008. Looking at the report for that auction, these auction rows were items
donated _by_ the Washington State Republican part that did not sell (hence the \$0 `amount`
values). Since there was no buyer, there is no `contributor_name` value.

I will flag these reports with a new `missing_flag` logical variable.

```{r flag_missing}
wa %>% 
  select(
    id, 
    report_number,
    contributor_name, 
    amount, 
    filer_name) %>% 
  map(count_na) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_na") %>% 
  mutate(prop_na = n_na / nrow(wa)) %>% 
  print(n = length(wa))

wa %>% 
  # select for the important vars
  select(
    id, 
    report_number,
    contributor_name, 
    amount, 
    filer_name,
    receipt_date) %>% 
  filter(is.na(contributor_name)) %>% 
  print(n = 27)

wa <- wa %>% mutate(missing_flag = is.na(contributor_name))
```

## Conclusion

The final data set now meets all our objectives:

1. There are `r nrow(wa)` records.
1. There are no duplicated records.
1. `amount` has a large range due to corrections, while `receipt_date` has a few
erroneous values do to entry errors (flagged with `date_flag`).
1. Missing data varies by nature of variable.
1. The `state_clean`, `city_clean`, and `address_clean` are all consistently uppercase without punctuation. Many spelling errors have been corrected in the first two.
1. The `zip5_clean` variable contains clean ZIP codes.
1. the `year_clean` variable contains clean receipt year values.
1. The 27 records missing contributor names have been flagged with the
`missing_flag` variable.

The overall number of distinct values has been reduced, allowing for better searching.

```{r confirm_n_distinct, collapse=TRUE}
n_distinct(wa$address_clean) - n_distinct(wa$contributor_address)
n_distinct(wa$city_clean)    - n_distinct(wa$contributor_city)  
n_distinct(wa$state_clean)   - n_distinct(wa$contributor_state) 
n_distinct(wa$zip5_clean)    - n_distinct(wa$contributor_zip)   
```

We can write two versions of the document. The first has all original columns along with cleaned
data in the `*_clean` columns. The second remove the original columns for file size reasons.

```{r write_csv}
dir_create(here("wa_contribs", "data", "processed"))
wa %>%
  # remove the original contributor_* columns for space
  select(
    -contributor_address,
    -contributor_city,
    -contributor_state,
    -contributor_zip
  ) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, str_squish) %>% 
  write_csv(
    path = here("wa_contribs", "data", "processed", "wa_contribs_clean.csv"),
    na = "",
  )
```
