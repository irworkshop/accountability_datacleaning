## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give
journalists, policy professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple
way to search across huge volumes of public data about people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each
dataset row as a transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3
variables:

1. All **parties** to a transaction.
2. The **date** of the transaction.
3. The **amount** of money involved.

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following objectives:

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for entirely duplicated records.
1. Check ranges of continuous variables.
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues.
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `zip`.
1. Create a `year` field from the transaction date.
1. Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction.

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze,
and communicate these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their
installation and attachment.

The IRW's `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub. This
package contains functions custom made to help facilitate the processing of
campaign finance data.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  gluedown, # printing markdown
  magrittr, # pipe operators
  janitor, # clean data frames
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  knitr, # knit documents
  vroom, # read files fast
  rvest, # html scraping
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative paths
  httr, # http requests
  fs # local storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a
sub-directory of the more general, language-agnostic
[`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][tap] GitHub repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][rproj] feature and should be
run as such. The project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file
paths relative to _your_ machine.

```{r where_here}
# where does this document knit?
here::here()
```

## Data

This data is obtained from the Delaware [Campaign Finance Reporting System][03].

On the [Expenditures search page][04], the CFRS describes what can be searched:

> An expenditure is defined as a gift, transfer, disbursement, debt incurred, or
promise of money or valuable thing by or on behalf of a political committee to
promote or assist in promoting the success or defeat of a candidate, political
party, or question at  an election. Expenditures must be election related; that
is, they must enhance the candidate's election chances, such that they would not
have been incurred if there had been no candidacy. Furthermore, expenditures,
including loans, may not be for the personal use of the candidate or any other
individual. Debt Incurred is any unpaid debt that the committee is obligated to
pay.

On [the FAQ page][05], the CFRS defines exactly what expenditures are reported.

>  All receipts over $100 must be itemized and all sales items over $50 must be
itemized. All contributions from a political committee shall be itemized no
matter what amount. If the person who made the contribution is an organization,
and the total amount of contributions by such organization during the election
period exceeds $1,200, then the report shall also include the name and address
of one responsible party for the organization.

## Download

We can download the raw file using a combination of `POST()` and `GET()`.

```{r raw_dir}
raw_dir <- dir_create(here("de", "expends", "data", "raw"))
raw_path <- path(raw_dir, "Expensesinfo.csv")
```

First, we use `httr::POST()` to fill out the CFRS form to return all results
from January 1, 2000 to today.

```{r raw_post}
de_post <- POST(
  url = "https://cfrs.elections.delaware.gov/Public/OtherSearch",
  body = list(
    hdnTP = "",
    ddlPayeeType = "",
    txtPayeeLastName = "",
    txtPayeeFirstName = "",
    txtStreet = "",
    txtTown = "",
    ddlState = "",
    txtZipCode = "",
    txtZipExt = "",
    txtCommitteeID = "",
    ddlExpenCategory = "",
    ddlExpensePurpose = "",
    MemberId = "",
    txtRegistrant = "",
    CommitteeType = "",
    dtStartDate = "1/1/2000",
    dtEndDate = format(today(), "%m/%d/%Y")
  )
)
```

Then, we can use `httr::cookies()` to get the cookies of that request.

```{r raw_cookies}
de_cookie <- cookies(de_post)$value
names(de_cookie) <- cookies(de_post)$name
```

Which can then be passed to `httr::GET()` to download the file.

```{r raw_get}
de_get <- GET(
  url = "https://cfrs.elections.delaware.gov/Public/ExportExpensestoCsv",
  set_cookies(de_cookie),
  write_disk(raw_path, overwrite = TRUE)
)
```

## Read

Before reading the file, we need to use regular expressions to fix two big
problems in the raw text file:
1. EQuation marks being used where they should be apostrophes
2. Errant newline characters in the middle of lines

```{r raw_fix}
fix_path <- file_temp()
read_file(raw_path) %>% 
  str_replace_all("\"", "'") %>% 
  str_remove_all("(?<!(Yes|No),)\n") %>% 
  write_file(path = fix_path)
```

This fixed text file can then be read with `readr::read_delim()`.

```{r raw_read}
dee <- read_delim(
  file = fix_path,
  delim = ",",
  trim_ws = TRUE,
  escape_backslash = FALSE,
  escape_double = FALSE,
  col_types = cols(
    .default = col_character(),
    `Expenditure Date` = col_date("%m/%d/%Y"),
    `Amount($)` = col_double()
  )
)
```

If the file was properly fixed and read, we can count the distinct values of a
known discrete variable like the logical `Fixed Asset`.

```{r raw_check}
count(dee, `Fixed Asset`)
```

For convenience, we can rename variables and remove the last empty column.

```{r raw_name}
old_names <- names(dee)[-ncol(dee)]
dee <- dee %>% 
  remove_empty("cols") %>% 
  clean_names("snake") %>% 
  mutate(across(fixed_asset, equals, "Y")) %>% 
  rename_all(str_remove, "payee_") %>% 
  rename_all(str_remove, "_name") %>% 
  rename_all(str_remove, "filing_") %>% 
  rename_all(str_remove, "expense_") %>% 
  rename_all(str_remove, "expenditure_") %>% 
  rename_all(str_replace, "address_line_", "addr")
```

## Explore

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(dee)
tail(dee)
```

### Missing

Variable differ in their degree of missing values.

```{r na_count}
col_stats(dee, count_na)
```

We can use `campfin::flag_na()` to identify records missing key variables.

```{r na_flag}
dee <- dee %>% flag_na(date, name, amount, committee)
percent(mean(dee$na_flag), 0.1)
```

```{r na_view}
dee %>% 
  filter(na_flag) %>% 
  select(date, name, amount, committee)
```

All of these missing _key_ values are in the `name` variable.

```{r na_names}
sum(dee$na_flag) == count_na(dee$name)
```

### Duplicates

```{r dupe_flag}
dee <- flag_dupes(dee, everything())
percent(mean(dee$dupe_flag), 0.1)
```

```{r dupe_view}
dee %>% 
  filter(dupe_flag) %>% 
  select(date, name, amount, committee)
```

### Categorical

```{r distinct_count}
col_stats(dee, n_distinct)
```

```{r distinct_plots}
explore_plot(dee, type)
explore_plot(dee, category)
explore_plot(dee, purpose)
explore_plot(dee, method)
```

### Amounts

```{r ammount_summary}
summary(dee$amount)
mean(dee$amount <= 0)
```

```{r hist_amount, echo=FALSE}
dee %>%
  filter(amount >= 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(amount)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = dark2["purple"]) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(1 %o% 10^(0:6)),
    labels = dollar,
    trans = "log10"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Delaware Expenditures Amount Distribution",
    caption = "Source: {source}",
    x = "Amount",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

### Dates

We can add the calendar year from `date` with `lubridate::year()`

```{r date_year}
dee <- mutate(dee, year = year(date))
```

There are no outlier dates, which makes sense given our records were returned
using a date range `POST()`.

```{r date_range}
min(dee$date)
sum(dee$year < 2000)
max(dee$date)
sum(dee$date > today())
```

```{r bar_year, echo=FALSE}
dee %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  mutate(even = is_even(year)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = even)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2020, by = 2)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "Delaware Expenditures by Year",
    caption = "Source: {source}",
    fill = "Election Year",
    x = "Year Made",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

## Wrangle

To improve the searchability of the database, we will perform some consistent,
confident string normalization. For geographic variables like city names and
ZIP codes, the corresponding `campfin::normal_*()` functions are tailor made to 
facilitate this process.

### Address

For the street `addresss` variable, the `campfin::normal_address()` function
will force consistence case, remove punctuation, and abbreviate official 
USPS suffixes.

```{r address_norm}
dee <- dee %>% 
  unite(
    col = addr_full,
    starts_with("addr"),
    sep = " ",
    remove = FALSE,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    addr_norm = normal_address(
      address = addr_full,
      abbs = usps_street,
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(-addr_full)
```

```{r address_view}
dee %>% 
  select(contains("addr")) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  sample_n(10)
```

### ZIP

For ZIP codes, the `campfin::normal_zip()` function will attempt to create
valid _five_ digit codes by removing the ZIP+4 suffix and returning leading
zeroes dropped by other programs like Microsoft Excel.

```{r zip_norm}
dee <- dee %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_norm = normal_zip(
      zip = zip,
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

```{r zip_progress}
progress_table(
  dee$zip,
  dee$zip_norm,
  compare = valid_zip
)
```

### State

Valid two digit state abbreviations can be made using the 
`campfin::normal_state()` function.

```{r state_norm}
dee <- dee %>% 
  mutate(
    state_norm = normal_state(
      state = state,
      abbreviate = TRUE,
      na_rep = TRUE,
      valid = valid_state
    )
  )
```

```{r state_view}
dee %>% 
  filter(state != state_norm) %>% 
  count(state, state_norm, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r state_progress}
progress_table(
  dee$state,
  dee$state_norm,
  compare = valid_state
)
```

### City

Cities are the most difficult geographic variable to normalize, simply due to
the wide variety of valid cities and formats.

#### Normal

The `campfin::normal_city()` function is a good start, again converting case,
removing punctuation, but _expanding_ USPS abbreviations. We can also remove
`invalid_city` values.

```{r city_norm}
dee <- dee %>% 
  mutate(
    city_norm = normal_city(
      city = city, 
      abbs = usps_city,
      states = c("DE", "DC", "DELAWARE"),
      na = invalid_city,
      na_rep = TRUE
    )
  )
```

#### Swap

We can further improve normalization by comparing our normalized value
against the _expected_ value for that record's state abbreviation and ZIP code.
If the normalized value is either an abbreviation for or very similar to the
expected value, we can confidently swap those two.

```{r city_swap}
dee <- dee %>% 
  rename(city_raw = city) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "state_norm" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(city_match = city) %>% 
  mutate(
    rx = glue("(?<=^|\\s){city_norm}(?=\\s|$)"),
    match_rx = str_detect(city_norm, rx),
    match_abb = is_abbrev(city_norm, city_match),
    match_dist = str_dist(city_norm, city_match),
    city_swap = if_else(
      condition = !is.na(match_dist) & (match_rx | match_abb | match_dist == 1),
      true = city_match,
      false = city_norm
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(
    -rx,
    -match_rx,
    -city_match,
    -match_dist,
    -match_abb
  )
```

#### Refine

The [OpenRefine][or] algorithms can be used to group similar strings and replace
the less common versions with their most common counterpart. This can greatly
reduce inconsistency, but with low confidence; we will only keep any refined
strings that have a valid city/state/zip combination.

[or]: https://openrefine.org/

```{r city_refine}
good_refine <- dee %>% 
  mutate(
    city_refine = city_swap %>% 
      key_collision_merge() %>% 
      n_gram_merge(numgram = 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_refine != city_swap) %>% 
  inner_join(
    y = zipcodes,
    by = c(
      "city_refine" = "city",
      "state_norm" = "state",
      "zip_norm" = "zip"
    )
  )
```

```{r city_count, echo=FALSE}
good_refine %>%
  count(
    state_norm, 
    zip_norm, 
    city_swap, 
    city_refine,
    sort = TRUE
  )
```

Then we can join the refined values back to the database.

```{r city_join}
dee <- dee %>% 
  left_join(good_refine) %>% 
  mutate(city_refine = coalesce(city_refine, city_swap))
```

#### Progress

```{r}
many_city <- c(valid_city, extra_city)
dee %>% 
  filter(city_refine %out% many_city) %>% 
  count(city_refine, state_norm, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

```{r}
dee <- mutate(
  .data = dee,
  city_refine = city_refine %>% 
    str_replace("^WILM$", "WILMINGTON")
)
```

```{r}
many_city <- c(many_city, "DEWEY BEACH", "LONG NECK")
```

```{r city_progress, echo=FALSE}
progress <- progress_table(
  str_to_upper(dee$city_raw),
  dee$city_norm,
  dee$city_swap,
  dee$city_refine,
  compare = many_city
) %>% mutate(stage = as_factor(stage))
kable(progress, digits = 3)
```

You can see how the percentage of valid values increased with each stage.

```{r bar_progress, echo=FALSE}
raw_in <- percent(prop_in(dee$city_raw, valid_city))
progress %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stage, y = prop_in)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.99) +
  geom_col(fill = dark2["purple"]) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.75, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  labs(
    title = "Delaware City Normalization Progress",
    subtitle = glue("Raw at {raw_in} before conversion to uppercase"),
    x = "Stage",
    y = "Percent Valid"
  )
```

More importantly, the number of distinct values decreased each stage. We were
able to confidently change many distinct invalid values to their valid
equivalent.

```{r bar_distinct, echo=FALSE}
progress %>% 
  select(
    stage, 
    all = n_distinct,
    bad = n_diff
  ) %>% 
  mutate(good = all - bad) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("good", "bad")) %>% 
  mutate(name = name == "good") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stage, y = value)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = name)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", direction = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "Delaware City Normalization Progress",
    subtitle = "Distinct values, valid and invalid",
    x = "Stage",
    y = "Distinct Values",
    fill = "Valid"
  )
```

## Conclude

Before exporting, we can remove the intermediary normalization columns and
rename all added variables with the `_clean` suffix.

```{r clean_select}
dee <- dee %>% 
  select(
    -city_norm,
    -city_swap,
    city_clean = city_refine
  ) %>% 
  rename_all(~str_replace(., "_norm", "_clean")) %>% 
  rename_all(~str_remove(., "_raw"))
```

```{r clean_glimpse}
glimpse(sample_n(dee, 20))
```

1. There are `r comma(nrow(dee))` records in the database.
1. There are `r comma(sum(dee$dupe_flag))` duplicate records in the database.
1. The range and distribution of `amount` and `date` seem reasonable.
1. There are `r comma(sum(dee$na_flag))` records missing key variables.
1. Consistency in geographic data has been improved with `campfin::normal_*()`.
1. The 4-digit `year` variable has been created with `lubridate::year()`.

## Export

Now the file can be saved on disk for upload to the Accountability server.

```{r clean_dir}
clean_dir <- dir_create(here("de", "expends", "data", "clean"))
clean_path <- path(clean_dir, "de_expends_clean.csv")
write_csv(dee, clean_path, na = "")
file_size(clean_path)
file_encoding(clean_path)
```

## Upload

Using the [duckr] R package, we can wrap around the [duck] commnand line tool to
upload the file to the IRW server.

[duckr]: https://github.com/kiernann/duckr
[duck]: https://duck.sh/

```{r clean_upload, eval=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("kiernann/duckr")
s3_dir <- "s3:/publicaccountability/csv/"
s3_path <- path(s3_dir, basename(clean_path))
if (require(duckr)) {
  duckr::duck_upload(clean_path, s3_path)
}
```

## Dictionary

The following table describes the variables in our final exported file:

```{r dict_make, echo=FALSE}
dict_raw <- tibble(
  var = md_code(names(dee)),
  old = c(md_code(old_names), rep("", ncol(dee) - length(old_names))),
  type = md_code(map_chr(dee, typeof)),
  def = c(
    "Date expenditure made",
    "Vendor name",
    "Vendor street address",
    "Vendor secondary address",
    "Vendor city name",
    "Vendor state abbreviation",
    "Vendor ZIP+4 code",
    "Vendor business type",
    "Expenditure amount",
    "Unique spending committee ID",
    "Spending committee name",
    "Expenditure category",
    "Purpose for expenditure",
    "Spending method",
    "Filing period reported",
    "Fixed asset (TRUE/FALSE)",
    "Flag for missing date, amount, or name",
    "Flag for completely duplicated record",
    "Calendar year of contribution date",
    "Normalized combined street address",
    "Normalized 5-digit ZIP code",
    "Normalized 2-digit state abbreviation",
    "Normalized city name"
  )
)
```

```{r dict_md, echo=FALSE}
(dict_md <- kable(
  x = dict_raw,
  format = "markdown",
  col.names = c("Column", "Original Name", "Type", "Definition")
))
```
