## Objectives

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called ZIP5
1. Create a YEAR field from the transaction date
1. For campaign donation data, make sure there is both a donor AND recipient

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze, and communicate
these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their installation and attachment.

```{r p_load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # date strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # data cleaning
  zipcode, # clean and compare
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  vroom, # read files fast
  rvest, # scrape web pages
  knitr, # knit documents
  httr, # acess web API
  here, # navigate local storage
  fs # search local storage 
)
```

## Data

Data comes courtesy of the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC)
[website](https://www.elec.state.nj.us/ELECReport/). The data can be downloaded from their 
["Quick Data Downloads"](https://www.elec.state.nj.us/publicinformation/quickdownload.htm) page in
four separate files:

* [`All_GUB_Text.zip`]("https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Gubernatorial/All_GUB_Text.zip")
* [`All_LEG_Text.zip`]("https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Legislative/All_LEG_Text.zip")
* [`All_CW_Text.zip`]("https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Countywide/All_CW_Text.zip")
* [`All_PAC_Text.zip`]("https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/PAC/All_PAC_Text.zip")

Each ZIP file contains a number of individual TXT files separated by year.

ELEC makes the following disclaimer at the bottom of the download page:

> The data contained in the ELEC database includes information as reported by candidates and
committees. Although ELEC has taken all reasonable precautions to prevent data entry errors, the
possibility that some exist cannot be entirely eliminated. Contributor and Expenditure types are
coded by ELEC staff members and are subjective according to the information provided by the filer.
Additionally, this information is subject to change as amendments are filed by candidates and
committees. For the most up-to-date information, please go to the “Search for Contributions” pages
to search for the most recent contributor information.

## Read

Since ELEC breaks up each year into a separate file and each groups them by contribution type, we
will have to do a little work to download, unzip, and read them all at once.

Furthermore, the delimiter used in each file is inconsistent, with some using tabs and others using
commas. The newly developed `vroom::vroom()` function is perfect for this situation, as it will
allow us to read all the unzipped files (~100) at once, with automatic detection of the delimiter.

First, we will get some general info on the files we are about to download. We want to be sure the
ZIP files aren't old, huge in size, or contain too many/suspicious files.

```{r pre_download, collapse=TRUE}
response <- GET("https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Gubernatorial/All_GUB_Text.zip")
utils:::format.object_size(as.numeric(headers(response)[["Content-Length"]]), "auto")
httr::headers(response)[["last-modified"]]
```

Then, create a list of files to be downloaded at once.

```{r}
nj_zip_urls <- c(
  "https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Gubernatorial/All_GUB_Text.zip", # (5.7 MB)
  "https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Legislative/All_LEG_Text.zip", # (9.7 MB)
  "https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/Countywide/All_CW_Text.zip", # (3.5 MB)
  "https://www.elec.state.nj.us/download/Data/PAC/All_PAC_Text.zip" # (6.2 MB)
)
```

If any of the files have not yet been downloaded today, download them again to ensure the latest
data from ELEC is being analyzed.

```{r download_files, collapse=TRUE}
# create a direcory for download
dir_create(here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw"))

# file date wrapper function
any_old_files <- function(path, glob) {
  # list files
  files <- dir_ls(
    path = path,
    type = "file",
    glob = glob
  )
  # if no files, FALSE
  if (length(files) == 0) {
    TRUE
  } else {
    # if any old files, FALSE
    file_info(files) %>% 
      pull(modification_time) %>% 
      floor_date("day") %>% 
      equals(today()) %>% 
      not() %>% 
      any()
  }
}

# download each file in the vector
if (any_old_files(here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw"), "*.zip")) {
  for (url in nj_zip_urls) {
    download.file(
      url = url,
      destfile = here(
        "nj_contribs",
        "data", "raw",
        basename(url)
      )
    )
  }
}
```

```{r view_zip}
nj_zip_files <- dir_ls(
  path = here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw"),
  type = "file",
  glob = "*.zip",
)

nj_zip_files %>% 
  map(unzip, list = TRUE) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "zip") %>%
  mutate(zip = basename(zip)) %>% 
  set_names(c("zip", "file", "bytes", "date")) %>%
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  print()
```

Each ZIP file contains individual text files for each election year. If the `/data` directory
does not already contain these files, or if any are older than a day, unzip them now.

```{r unzip}
if (any_old_files(here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw"), "*.txt")) {
  map(
    nj_zip_files,
    unzip,
    exdir = here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw"),
    overwrite = TRUE
  )
}
```

While every file has the same structure, the _names_ of those columns vary slightly. In some, there
is an `occupation` variable; in others, that _same_ variable is named `occupation_name`. This
incongruity prevents them from all being read together with `vroom::vroom()`. We can solve this by
extracting the variable names from a single file and using those to name every file's columns.

```{r make_names}
nj_names <-
  here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw") %>%
  dir_ls(type = "file", glob = "*.txt") %>%
  extract(1) %>%
  read.table(nrows = 1, sep = "\t", header = FALSE) %>%
  as_vector() %>%
  make_clean_names()
```

One we have this vector of column names, we can read each file into a single data frame. Every
column will be read as character strings and parsed after the fact using the `dplyr::parse_*()`
functions. Normally we would use `col_types = cols(cont_date = col_date())`, but this seems to
introduce a number of `NA` values from some unknown parsing error that is does not happen with
`dplyr::parse_date()`.

```{r vroom_read}
nj <-
  here("nj_contribs", "data", "raw") %>%
  dir_ls(type = "file", glob = "*.txt") %>%
  vroom(
    delim = NULL,
    col_names = nj_names,
    col_types = cols(.default = "c"),
    id = "source_file",
    skip = 1,
    trim_ws = TRUE,
    locale = locale(tz = "US/Eastern"),
    progress = FALSE
  ) %>%
  # parse non-character cols
  mutate(
    source_file = basename(source_file) %>% str_remove("\\.txt$"),
    cont_date   = parse_date(cont_date, "%m/%d/%Y"),
    cont_amt    = parse_number(cont_amt)
  )
```

## Explore and Flag

Below is the structure of the data arranged randomly by row. There are `r nrow(nj)` rows of 
`r length(nj)` variables.

```{r glimpse_all}
glimpse(sample_frac(nj))
```

### Dates

The hard files contain data on elections from `r min(nj$election_year)` to `r
max(nj$election_year)`. When you filter out those contributions made before 2008, more than 2/3rds
of the data is removed.

```{r filter_date, collapse=TRUE}
sum(nj$cont_date < "2008-01-01", na.rm = TRUE) / nrow(nj)
min(nj$cont_date, na.rm = TRUE)
max(nj$cont_date, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Although the data does become more abundant as time goes on, there is still a significant number
of records before our 2008 time frame.

```{r plot_n_year, echo=FALSE}
nj %>% 
  group_by(year = year(cont_date)) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1978, 2015)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1978:2015) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Records Over Time",
    subtitle = "New Jersey ELEC Contribution Files",
    x = "Contribution Year",
    y = "Number of Records"
  )
```

Regardless, (for now) we will filter out any contributions made before 2008.

```{r}
nj <- nj %>% 
  filter(year(cont_date) > 2008)
```

### Distinct Values

The variables vary in their degree of distinctiveness.

```{r count_distinct}
nj %>% 
  map(n_distinct) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_distinct") %>% 
  mutate(prop_distinct = round(n_distinct / nrow(nj), 4)) %>%
  print(n = length(nj))
```

For the least distinct variables, we can explore the most common values.

```{r tabyls_function, echo=FALSE}
print_tabyl <- function(data, ...) {
  as_tibble(arrange(tabyl(data, ...), desc(n)))
}
```

```{r print_tabyls}
print_tabyl(nj, source_file)
print_tabyl(nj, party)
print_tabyl(nj, election_year) %>% arrange(election_year)
print_tabyl(nj, cont_type)
print_tabyl(nj, receipt_type)
print_tabyl(nj, office)
print_tabyl(nj, cont_state)
print_tabyl(nj, occupation)
print_tabyl(nj, election_type)
```

### Plot

We can create some visualizations to better help us understand the value of these distinct and 
continuous variables. 

**Note that all contribution amount values have been scaled logarithmically on both the X and Y**
**axis to account for the incredibly skewed distribution.**

```{r plot_non_log, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}
nj %>% 
  filter(party != "OTHER (ANY COMBINATION OF DEM/REP/IND)") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cont_amt)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = party)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "forestgreen", "purple", "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~party) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution Distribution",
    subtitle = "by political Party",
    y = "Number of Contributions",
    x = "Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

```{r plot_amt_party, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}
nj %>% 
  filter(party != "OTHER (ANY COMBINATION OF DEM/REP/IND)") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cont_amt)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = party)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "forestgreen", "purple", "red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~party) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution Distribution",
    subtitle = "by political Party",
    y = "Number of Contributions",
    x = "Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

```{r plot_amt_year, echo=FALSE}
nj %>% 
  filter(election_year > 2008) %>% 
  filter(party != "OTHER (ANY COMBINATION OF DEM/REP/IND)") %>% 
  group_by(election_year, party) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(cont_amt)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = election_year, y = sum)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = party)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "forestgreen", "purple", "red"))
```

```{r plot_amt_cont, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}
nj %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cont_amt)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~cont_type) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution Distribution",
    subtitle = "by Contribution Type",
    y = "Number of Contributions",
    x = "Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

```{r plot_amt_rec, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}
nj %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cont_amt)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~receipt_type) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution Distribution",
    subtitle = "by Recipient Type",
    y = "Number of Contributions",
    x = "Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

```{r plot_amt_elec, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}
nj %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cont_amt)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~election_type) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution Distribution",
    subtitle = "by Election Type",
    y = "Number of Contributions",
    x = "Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

```{r plot_amt_state, fig.height=14}
nj %>% 
  group_by(cont_state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_cont = median(cont_amt)) %>%
  filter(cont_state %in% c(state.abb, "DC")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(cont_state, -mean_cont), mean_cont)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Median Contribution Amount",
    subtitle = "by Contributor's State",
    x = "State",
    y = "Mean Amount ($USD)"
  )
```

### Duplicate Records

There are `r nrow(nj)-nrow(distinct(nj))` rows with duplicates values in every variable. Over 1% of
rows are complete duplicates.

```{r n_distinct, collapse=TRUE}
nrow(distinct(nj)) - nrow(nj)
```

```{r get_dupes}
# create dupes df
nj_dupes <- nj %>% 
  get_dupes() %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(dupe_flag = TRUE)

# show dupes
nj_dupes %>% 
  mutate(rec = coalesce(rec_lname, rec_non_ind_name)) %>% 
  select(
    cont_lname,
    cont_amt,
    cont_date,
    rec,
    dupe_count,
    dupe_flag
  )
```

Flag these duplicate rows by joining the duplicate table with the original data.

```{r flag_dupes, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
nj <- nj %>% 
  left_join(nj_dupes) %>% 
  mutate(
    dupe_count = ifelse(is.na(dupe_count), 1, dupe_count),
    dupe_flag  = !is.na(dupe_flag)
    )
```

Since there is no entirely unique variable to track contributions, we will create one.

```{r rownames_to_column, collapse=TRUE}
nj <- nj %>%
  # unique row num id
  rownames_to_column(var = "id") %>% 
  # make all same width
  mutate(id = str_pad(
    string = id, 
    width = max(nchar(id)), 
    side = "left", 
    pad = "0")
  )

# distinct for every row
n_distinct(nj$id) == nrow(nj)
```

### Mising Values

The variables also vary in their degree of values that are `NA` (empty). 

Many of these variables are understandably `NA`; there cannot, for example, be both a `cont_lname`
and `cont_non_ind_name` value for a single record, as these two variables are mutually exclusive.
These mutually exclusive variables cover 100% of records.

```{r mutually_exclusive, collapse=TRUE}
# prop NA each sum to 1
mean(is.na(nj$rec_lname)) + mean(is.na(nj$rec_non_ind_name))
```

Other variables like `cont_mname` or `cont_suffix` simply aren't recorded as frequently or as
common as the required `cont_lname` (for a single person).

It's notable that many important variables (e.g., `cont_type`, `cont_amt`, `cont_date`, `office`)
contain _zero_ `NA` values.

The geographic contributor variables (e.g., `cont_zip`, `cont_city`) each contain 2-3% `NA` values.

The full count of `NA` for each variable in the data frame can be found below:

```{r count_na}
nj %>% 
  map(function(var) sum(is.na(var))) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_na") %>% 
  mutate(prop_na = n_na / nrow(nj)) %>% 
  print(n = length(nj))
```

## Clean

New variables will be added with _cleaned_ versions of the original data. Cleaning follows the
[IRW data cleaning guide](https://github.com/irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning/blob/master/R_contribs/accountability_datacleaning/IRW_guides/data_check_guide.md). Cleaned variables will all
match the `*_clean` name syntax.

This primarily means correcting obvious spelling and structure mistakes in Address, City, State,
and ZIP variables. Steps will also be taken to remove punctuation and make strings consistently
uppercase. New variables will also be made from the original data to match the searching parameters
of the Accountability Project database. Rows with unresolvable errors in `*_clean` will be flagged
with a logical `*_flag` variable.

Ultimately, each cleaned variable should contain less distinct values. This would indicate typos
have been corrected and invalid values made `NA`.

### Create Year

Since the `cont_date` variable was parsed as an R date object through `readr::parse_date()`, the
`lubridate::year()` function makes it easy to extract the contribution year from the contribution
date.

```{r mutate_year}
# extract year variable
nj <- nj %>% 
  mutate(cont_year = year(cont_date))
```

Note that this new `cont_year` variable, _does not_ always equal the `election_year` variable.

```{r year_vars_diff, collapse=TRUE}
mean(nj$cont_year == nj$election_year)
```

There are a number of year variables that don't make any sense. Since we previously filtered any
date before 2008-01-01, the only erroneous dates are from the future. There are 
`r sum(nj$cont_date > today())` records with date values from the future. They can be flagged with
a new `date_flag` variable.

```{r view_future, echo=FALSE}
# view futures contribs
nj %>% 
  filter(cont_date > today()) %>% 
  arrange(cont_date) %>% 
  mutate(cont = coalesce(cont_lname, cont_non_ind_name)) %>% 
  mutate(rec = coalesce(rec_lname, rec_non_ind_name)) %>% 
  select(cont_date, cont, cont_amt, rec, source_file) %>% 
  print()
```

```{r flag_dates}
# flag future contribs
nj <- nj %>% 
  mutate(date_flag = cont_date > today())
```

### ZIP Code

The `zipcodes::clean.zipcodes()` function automates many of the required steps to clean US Zip code
strings. From the function documentation:

> Attempts to detect and clean up suspected ZIP codes. Will strip "ZIP+4" suffixes to match format
of zipcode data.frame. Restores leading zeros, converts invalid entries to NAs, and returns
character vector. Note that this function does not attempt to find a matching ZIP code in the
database, but rather examines formatting alone.

The `zipcode` package also contains a useful `zipcode` database: 

> This package contains a database of city, state, latitude, and longitude information for U.S. ZIP
codes from the CivicSpace Database (August 2004) and augmented by Daniel Coven's
federalgovernmentzipcodes.us web site (updated January 22, 2012).

```{r}
data("zipcode")

zipcode <- zipcode %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(city, state, zip) %>% 
  mutate(city = str_to_upper(city))

zipcode %>% sample_n(10)
```

```{r mutate_zip5, collapse=TRUE}
nj <- nj %>% mutate(zip5 = clean.zipcodes(cont_zip))

nj$zip5 <- nj$zip5 %>% 
  na_if("0") %>% 
  na_if("000000") %>% 
  na_if("999999")

n_distinct(nj$cont_zip)
n_distinct(nj$zip5)
```

We can filter for zip codes that are not five characters long and compare them against the first valid zipcode for that contributor's city and state. If need be, the `cont_street1` can be looked
up to get an exact ZIP.

```{r}
nj_bad_zip <- nj %>% 
  filter(nchar(zip5) != 5) %>% 
  select(id, cont_street1, cont_city, cont_state, cont_zip, zip5) %>% 
  left_join(zipcode, by = c("cont_city" = "city", "cont_state" = "state")) %>% 
  rename(clean_zip = zip5, valid_zip = zip)

print(nj_bad_zip)
```

Then some of these typo ZIPs can be corrected explicitly using their unique `id`. Most either
contain an erroneous leading zero or trailing digit.

```{r zip_fix_manual, collapse=TRUE}
nj$zip5[nj$id %in% nj_bad_zip$id] <- c(
  "07083", # (070083) valid union
  "08816", # (008816) valid NJ
  "08302", # (080302) valid bridgeton
  "63105", # (631053) valid stl
  "08077", # (089077) valid cinnaminson
  "08691", # (086914) valid hamilton
  "08872", # (088872) valid sayreville
  "10013", # (100313) valid nyc
  "83713", # (083713) valid boise
  "07932", # (079325) valid florham
  "08028", # (08)     valid glassboro
  "08902", # (008902) valid n brunswick
  "07666", # (076666) valid teaneck
  "07047", # (07)     valid jersey city
  "84201", # (084201) valid ogden
  "08902"  # (008902) valid n brunswick
)

n_distinct(nj$zip5)
sum(nchar(nj$zip5) != 5, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### State Abbreviations

We can clean states abbreviations by comparing the `cont_state` variable values against a
comprehensive list of valid abbreviations.

The `zipcode` database also contains many city names and the full list of abbreviations for all US
states, territories, and military mail codes (as opposed to `datasets::state.abb`).

I will add rows for the Canadian provinces from Wikipedia. The capital city and largest city are
included alongside the proper provincial abbreviation. Canada uses a different ZIP code convention,
so that data cannot be included.

```{r can_abbs, collapse=TRUE}
canadian_abbs <-
  read_html("https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada") %>%
  html_node("#mw-content-text > div > table:nth-child(10)") %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>% 
  as_tibble(.name_repair = make_clean_names) %>% 
  slice(-1, -nrow(.)) %>% 
  select(postalabbrev, capital_1, largestcity_2) %>%
  rename(state = postalabbrev,
         capital = capital_1, 
         queen = largestcity_2) %>% 
  gather(-state, capital, queen,
         key = type,
         value = city) %>% 
  select(-type) %>% 
  distinct()
```

We can use this database to locate records with invalid values and compare them against possible
valid values.

```{r valid_abb}
zipcode <- zipcode %>% 
  bind_rows(canadian_abbs) %>%
  mutate(city = str_to_upper(city))

valid_abb <- sort(unique(zipcode$state))
setdiff(valid_abb, state.abb)
```

Here, we can see most invalid `cont_state` values are reasonable typos that can be corrected.

```{r view_bad_abbs, echo=FALSE}
nj %>% 
  filter(!(cont_state %in% valid_abb)) %>% 
  select(id, cont_city, cont_state, cont_zip) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cont_state)) %>% 
  left_join(
    y = zipcode %>% select(zip, city, state), 
    by = c("cont_zip" = "zip")
  )
```

```{r clean_abbs, collapse=TRUE}
sum(!(na.omit(nj$cont_state) %in% valid_abb))
n_distinct(nj$cont_state)

nj$state_clean <- nj$cont_state %>% 
  str_replace_all(pattern = "MJ", replacement = "NJ") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^N$", "NJ") %>% 
  str_replace_all("NK",  "NJ") %>% 
  str_replace_all("TE",  "TN") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^P$", "PA") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^7$", "PA")

sum(!(na.omit(nj$state_clean) %in% valid_abb))
n_distinct(nj$state_clean)
```

Over 98% of all contributions have a `state_clean` value from the top 10 most common states.

```{r tabyl_state}
nj %>% 
  tabyl(state_clean) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(cum_percent = cumsum(percent))
```

### City Names

The State of New Jersey publishes a comprehensive list of all municipalities in the state. We can
read that file from the internet to check the `cont_city` variable values.

Not all contributions come from New Jersey, but 9/10 do so this list is a good start.

```{r read_muni}
nj_muni <- 
  read_tsv(
    file = "https://www.nj.gov/infobank/muni.dat", 
    col_names = c("muni", "county", "old_code", "tax_code", "district", "fed_code", "county_code"),
    col_types = cols(.default = col_character())
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    county = str_to_upper(county),
    muni   = str_to_upper(muni)
  )

nj_valid_muni <- sort(unique(nj_muni$muni))
```

With this list and the fairly comprehensive list of cities from other states, we can isolate only
the most suspicious `cont_city` values.

There are `r sum(!(nj$cont_city %in% c(nj_valid_muni, zipcode$city)))` records (~5%) with a
`cont_city` value not in either of these two lists. Of these suspicious records, there are
`r n_distinct(nj$cont_city[!(nj$cont_city %in% c(nj_valid_muni, zipcode$city))])` distinct 
`cont_city`values.

We can expand our list of valid city values to include those without the municipality type suffix,
those with the full version of the suffix, and those with the suffix but without punctuation.

```{r expand_muni}
nj_without_suffix <- nj_valid_muni %>% 
  str_remove("[:punct:]") %>% 
  str_remove("\\b(\\w+)$") %>% 
  str_trim()

nj_no_punct <- nj_valid_muni %>% 
  str_remove_all("[:punct:]")

nj_full_suffix <- nj_valid_muni %>% 
  str_replace("TWP\\.$", "TOWNSHIP")

all_valid_muni <- sort(unique(c(
  # variations on valid NJ munis
  nj_valid_muni,
  nj_without_suffix, 
  nj_no_punct,
  nj_full_suffix,
  # valid cities outside NJ
  zipcode$city,
  # very common valid unincorperated places
  "WHITEHOUSE STATION",
  "MCAFEE",
  "GLEN MILLS",
  "KINGS POINT"
)))
```

After this full list is created, there are now only `r sum(!(nj$cont_city %in% all_valid_muni))`
records with a `cont_city` value not in our extended list. There are 
`r n_distinct(nj$cont_city[!(nj$cont_city %in% all_valid_muni)])` distinct `cont_city` values
that need to be checked or corrected.

```{r view_bad}
nj_bad_city <- nj %>%
  filter(!(cont_city %in% all_valid_muni)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cont_city)) %>% 
  select(id, cont_street1, state_clean, zip5, cont_city)
```

Many (almost all) of these "bad" `cont_city` values are valid city names simply not in the created
list of municipalities. They are either too obscure, are unincorporated territories, or have too
many valid spelling variations. Almost 50% of all "bad" values are from the 10 most common, and are
all actually valid.

```{r count_bad}
nj_bad_city %>% 
  group_by(cont_city, state_clean) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = n / sum(n),
    cumsum = cumsum(n),
    cumprop = cumsum(prop)
  )
```

Invalid `cont_city` values are going to be corrected using key collision and ngram fingerprint
algorithms from the open source tool OpenRefine. These algorithms are ported to R in the package
`refinr`. These tools are able to correct many simple errors, but I will be double checking
the table and making changes in R.

First, we will create the `city_prep` variable, 

A separate table will be used to correct the `cont_city` values in the original table. The
`city_prep` variable is created by expanding abbreviations and removes common non-city information.
The `city_prep` value is refined using `refinr::key_collision_merge()` and
`refinr::n_gram_merge()`. Unchanged rows are removed, as well as non-geographical information.

```{r city_prep, collapse=TRUE}
nj_city_fix <- nj %>%  
  rename(city_original = cont_city) %>%
  select(
    id,
    cont_street1,
    state_clean,
    zip5,
    city_original
  ) %>% 
  mutate(city_prep = city_original %>%
           str_to_upper() %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)N(\\b|$)",  "NORTH") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)S(\\b|$)",  "SOUTH") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)E(\\b|$)",  "EAST") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)W(\\b|$)",  "WEST") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)MT(\\b|$)", "MOUNT") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)ST(\\b|$)", "SAINT") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)PT(\\b|$)", "PORT") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)FT(\\b|$)", "FORT") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)PK(\\b|$)", "PARK") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)JCT(\\b|$)", "JUNCTION") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)TWP(\\b|$)", "TOWNSHIP") %>%
           str_replace_all("(^|\\b)TWP\\.(\\b|$)", "TOWNSHIP") %>%
           str_remove("(^|\\b)NJ(\\b|$)") %>%
           str_remove("(^|\\b)NY(\\b|$)") %>%
           str_remove_all(fixed("\\")) %>%
           str_replace_all("\\s\\s", " ") %>% 
           str_trim() %>% 
           na_if("")
  )

sum(nj_city_fix$city_original != nj_city_fix$city_prep, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The new `city_prep` variable is fed into the OpenRefine algorithm and a new `city_fix` variable is
returned. Records unchanged by this process are removed and the table is formatted.

```{r refine, collapse=TRUE}
nj_city_fix <- nj_city_fix %>% 
  # refine the prepared variable
  mutate(city_fix = city_prep %>%
           # edit to match valid munis
           key_collision_merge(dict = all_valid_muni) %>%
           n_gram_merge()) %>%
  # create logical change variable
  mutate(fixed = city_prep != city_fix) %>%
  # keep only changed records
  filter(fixed) %>%
  # group by fixes
  arrange(city_fix) %>% 
  select(-fixed)

nrow(nj_city_fix)
nj_city_fix %>% 
  select(city_original, city_fix) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
```

Not all of the changes made to create `city_fix` should have been made. We can "accept" any change
that resulted in a state, zip, and city combination that matches the `zipcode` database. Almost
exactly half of the `city_fix` variables _definitely_ fixed a misspelled city name. Not bad.

```{r good_fix}
good_fix <- nj_city_fix %>%
  inner_join(
    y = zipcode,
    by = c(
      "zip5" = "zip",
      "city_fix" = "city",
      "state_clean" = "state"
    )
  )

nrow(good_fix) # total changes made
n_distinct(good_fix$city_fix) # distinct changes
print(good_fix)
```

Those changes without a full matching combination should be checked and corrected.

```{r bad_fix}
bad_fix <- nj_city_fix %>%
  filter(!(id %in% good_fix$id))

nrow(bad_fix)
print(bad_fix)

# these 6 erroneous changes account for 4/5 bad fixes
bad_fix$city_fix <- bad_fix$city_fix %>% 
  str_replace_all("^DOUGLASVILLE", "DOUGLASSVILLE") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^FOREST LAKE", "LAKE FOREST") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^GLENN MILLS", "GLEN MILLS") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^LAKE SPRING", "SPRING LAKE") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^WHITE HOUSE STATION", "WHITEHOUSE STATION") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^WINSTON SALEM", "WINSTON-SALEM")

# last 25 changes
bad_fix %>% 
  filter(city_original != city_fix) %>% 
  filter(!(city_fix %in% all_valid_muni)) %>% 
  print(n = nrow(.))

bad_fix$city_fix <- bad_fix$city_fix %>% 
  str_replace_all("^AVENTURA", "VENTURA") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^BERARDSVILLE", "BERNARDSVILLE") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^FOREST HILL", "FOREST HILLS") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^FOREST RIVER", "RIVER FOREST") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^MALVERN", "MALVERN") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^MC AFEE", "MCAFEE") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^NARBETH", "NARBERTH") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^ORRISTOWN", "MORRISTOWN") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^NMORRISTOWN", "MORRISTOWN") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^KINGSPOINT", "KINGS POINT") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^MILLSTONE BOROUGH", "MILLSTONE BORO") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^PLAINFEILD", "PLAINFIELD") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^RIVERVIEW", "RIVERVIEW") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^ROLLING HILL ESTATES$", "ROLLING HILLS ESTATES") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^SHARK RIVER HILL", "SHARK RIVER HILLS") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^TAREYTOWN", "TARRYTOWN") %>% 
  str_replace_all("^WELLSLEY HILLS", "WELLESLEY HILLS")
```

After fixing the bad fixes, the two tables of fixed spellings can be combined.

```{r all_fix}
if (nrow(good_fix) + nrow(bad_fix) == nrow(nj_city_fix)) {
  nj_city_fix <- 
    bind_rows(good_fix, bad_fix) %>% 
    select(id, city_original, city_fix) %>% 
    filter(city_original != city_fix)
}

print(nj_city_fix)
```

Using the unique `id` variable, replace the incorrectly spelled `cont_city` values with the
refined and corrected `city_fix` values from the new table. In a final `city_clean` variable, use
`city_fix` where changes were made, otherwise use the original `cont_city`.

```{r fix_city_join, collapse=TRUE}
nj <- nj %>% 
  left_join(nj_city_fix, by = "id") %>% 
  mutate(city_clean = ifelse(is.na(city_fix), cont_city, city_fix)) %>% 
  select(-city_original, -city_fix)

n_distinct(nj$cont_city)
n_distinct(nj$city_clean)

nj %>% 
  filter(cont_city != city_clean) %>% 
  select(id, cont_city, city_clean, state_clean) %>% 
  sample_frac()
```

There are a few other changes that need to be made using a lookup table available in the `data`
directory.

```{r city_lookup, collapse=TRUE}
nj_city_lookup <- read_csv(
  file = here("nj_contribs", "data", "nj_city_lookup.csv"), 
  col_names = c("city_clean", "city_new", "count"),
  skip = 1
)

nj <- nj %>% 
  left_join(nj_city_lookup, by = "city_clean") %>% 
  select(-city_clean, -count) %>% 
  rename(city_clean = city_new)

n_distinct(nj$city_clean)
```

## Missing Parties

To ensure every columns contains some kind of identifying information on both the contributor and
recipient, we can united individual names and coalesce the united variable with non-individual
names. This captures all names for both contributors and donors. We then select for key variables
and identify any remaining missing values.

```{r key_vars, collapse=TRUE}
nj_key_vars <- nj %>%
  replace_na(
    list(
      cont_lname  = "",
      cont_fname  = "",
      cont_mname  = "",
      cont_suffix = ""
    )
  ) %>% 
  # unite first and last names
  unite(cont_fname, cont_mname, cont_lname, cont_suffix,
        col = cont_full_name,
        sep = " ") %>%
  # remove empty unites
  mutate(cont_full_name = na_if(str_trim(cont_full_name), "")) %>% 
  # repeat for non-individual contributors
  replace_na(
    list(
      cont_non_ind_name  = "",
      cont_non_ind_name2  = ""
    )
  ) %>% 
  unite(cont_non_ind_name, cont_non_ind_name2,
        col = cont_non_ind_name,
        sep = " ") %>%
  mutate(cont_non_ind_name = na_if(str_trim(cont_non_ind_name), "")) %>% 
  # coalesce ind and non-ind united names into single variable
  mutate(cont = coalesce(cont_full_name, cont_non_ind_name)) %>% 
  # repeat for recipients
  replace_na(
    list(
      rec_lname  = "",
      rec_fname  = "",
      rec_mname  = "",
      rec_suffix = ""
    )
  ) %>% 
  # unite first and last names
  unite(rec_fname, rec_mname, rec_lname, rec_suffix,
        col = rec_full_name,
        sep = " ") %>%
  # remove empty unites
  mutate(rec_full_name = na_if(str_trim(rec_full_name), "")) %>% 
  # repeat for non-individual contributors
  replace_na(
    list(
      rec_non_ind_name  = "",
      rec_non_ind_name2  = ""
    )
  ) %>% 
  unite(rec_non_ind_name, rec_non_ind_name2,
        col = rec_non_ind_name,
        sep = " ") %>%
  mutate(rec_non_ind_name = na_if(str_trim(rec_non_ind_name), "")) %>% 
  # coalesce ind and non-ind united names into single variable
  mutate(rec = coalesce(rec_full_name, rec_non_ind_name)) %>% 
  # select key vars
  select(id, cont_date, cont_type, cont_amt, cont, rec)


print(nj_key_vars)
nrow(nj_key_vars)
nrow(distinct(nj_key_vars))
nrow(drop_na(nj_key_vars))
```

There are `r nrow(nj_key_vars) - nrow(drop_na(nj_key_vars))` records with missing contributor
information. We will flag these variables with a new `na_flag` variable based on their unique `id`.

```{r check_key_na}
nj_key_vars %>% 
  map(function(var) sum(is.na(var))) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  enframe(name = "variable", value = "n_na")

nj <- nj %>% 
  mutate(na_flag = id %in% nj_key_vars$id[is.na(nj_key_vars$cont)])
```

## Conclusion

1. There are `r nrow(nj)` records in the database
1. There are `r sum(nj$dupe_flag)` duplicated records (flagged with `dupe_flag`)
1. There are `r sum(nj$date_flag)` dates from the future (flagged with `date_flag`)
1. The degree of blank or missing values varies by variable
1. City, state, and ZIP code consistency issues have been remedied (`*_clean` variables)
1. The five-digit ZIP Code variable is named `zip5`
1. The YEAR field from the transaction date is named `cont_year`
1. There are `r sum(nj$na_flag)` records missing contributor names (flagged with `na_flag`)

```{r view_flagged}
nj %>% 
  select(
    id,
    cont_date, 
    cont_type, 
    cont_amt,
    ends_with("clean"),
    ends_with("flag")
  )
```

## Write

```{r write_clean}
dir_create(here("nj_contribs", "data", "processed"))
nj %>% 
  # remove unclean cols
  select(
    -cont_city,
    -cont_state,
    -cont_zip
  ) %>% 
  # write to disk
  write_csv(
    path = here("nj_contribs", "data", "processed", "nj_contribs_clean.csv"),
    na = ""
  )
```
