## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give
journalists, policy professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple
way to search across huge volumes of public data about people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each
dataset row as a transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3
variables:

1. All **parties** to a transaction
2. The **date** of the transaction
3. The **amount** of money involved

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze,
and communicate these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their
installation and attachment.

The IRW's `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub. This
package contains functions custom made to help facilitate the processing of
campaign finance data.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, dfrning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  knitr, # knit documents
  vroom, # read files fast
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a
sub-directory of the more general, language-agnostic
[`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][01] GitHub
repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][02] feature and should be
run as such. The project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file
paths relative to _your_ machine.

```{r where_here, collapse=TRUE}
# where does this document knit?
here::here()
```

## Data

Data from the California Secretary of State's [Cal-Access database][03].

> Cal-Access provides financial information supplied by state candidates,
donors, lobbyists, and others. Simply start by selecting either Campaign Finance
Activity, Lobbying Activity, or Cal-Access Resources and we will guide you to
the information.

### About

All California campaign finance data can be downloaded in a single file. As
described on PRD website:

> ### Raw Data for Campaign Finance and Lobbying Activity  
> In addition to presenting California campaign finance and lobbying activity on
the user-friendly [CAL-ACCESS website][05], the Secretary of State provides the
raw data to allow people with technical expertise to create their own databases.
> 
> The raw data is presented in tab-delimited text files from corresponding
tables in the CAL-ACCESS database. Users can uncompress and extract the data
with standard software such as PKZIP, WinZip, or MacZip. The Secretary of State
does not provide technical support to users who want to download and analyze
CAL-ACCESS data in this advanced way. However, the Secretary of State offers
guides to the CAL-ACCESS data structure and fields.

> ### Download Files  
* [Guides to CAL-ACCESS data structure and fields (ZIP)][06]
* [CAL-ACCESS raw data (ZIP)][07]
> 
> All CAL-ACCESS users should keep in mind that campaign finance and lobbying
activity information changes often. The raw data extracts are updated once a
day. Campaign finance and lobbying activity filings can also be obtained in hard
copy by contacting the Secretary of State's Political Reform Division.

[07]: https://campaignfinance.cdn.sos.ca.gov/dbwebexport.zip

### Variables

Using the data key provided by Cal-Access, we can find the lobbyists file and
understand it's contents.

```{r check_key}
key_url <- "https://campaignfinance.cdn.sos.ca.gov/calaccess-documentation.zip"
url_file_size(key_url)
```

If they ZIP file containing the documentation files has not yet been downloaded, we can do so now.

```{r download_key}
doc_dir <- here("ca", "lobby", "docs")
key_file <- str_c(doc_dir, basename(key_url), sep = "/")
if (!this_file_new(key_file)) {
  download.file(
    url = key_url,
    destfile = key_file
  )
}
```

Before we unzip the file, we can view it's contents.

```{r list_key}
key_content <- as_tibble(unzip(key_file, list = TRUE))
print(key_content)
```

```{r unzip_key}
key_dir <- str_c(doc_dir, key_content$Name[1], sep = "/")
if (!dir_exists(key_dir)) {
  unzip(
    zipfile = key_file,
    exdir = doc_dir
  )
}
file_delete(key_file)
```

## Import

### Download

```{r zip_file}
raw_dir <- dir_create(here("ca", "lobby", "data", "raw"))
zip_url <- "https://campaignfinance.cdn.sos.ca.gov/dbwebexport.zip"
zip_file <- str_c(raw_dir, basename(zip_url), sep = "/")
```

The ZIP file is extremelly large, and will take quite some time 

```{r file_size}
url_file_size(zip_url)
if (requireNamespace("speedtest", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # speedtest::spd_test()
}
```

If the most recent version of the file has not yet been downloaded, we can do so now.

```{r download_raw}
if (!this_file_new(zip_file)) {
  download.file(
    url = zip_url,
    destfile = zip_file
  )
}
```

We don't need to unzip every file, only those pertaining to lobbying.

```{r list_zip}
zip_content <- unzip(zip_file, list = TRUE) 
zip_lobby <- zip_content$Name[str_which(zip_content$Name, "LOBBY")]
cal_dir <- str_c(raw_dir, unique(dirname(zip_lobby)), sep = "/")
```

Then, if those files have not yet been unzipped, we can do so now.

```{r unzip_zip}
if (!dir_exists(cal_dir)) {
  unzip(
    zipfile = zip_file,
    files = zip_lobby,
    exdir = raw_dir
  )
}
```

### Read

Much of the data is split into multiple files. We will list all the files of a similar name and
read them into a single data frame with `purrr::map_dfr()` and `readr::read_tsv()`.

The `CVR_LOBBY_DISCLOSURE_CD.TSV` file lists the information from every F615, F635, F625, F645
form, which are submitted by principal clients employing lobbying efforts (LEM) and contains
records for every lobbying firm (FRM), individual person (IND), lobbyists (LBY), andlobbying
coalitions (LCO).

> Lobbyist contribution disclosure table. Temporary table used to generate disclosure table
(Lobbyist Contributions 3).

```{r read_conts}
lob_conts <- map_dfr(
  .x = dir_ls(
    path = cal_dir, 
    type = "file", 
    glob = "*LOBBYIST_CONTRIBUTIONS\\d_CD.TSV$"

  .f = read_tsv,
  col_types = cols(

    RECIPIENT_NAME = col_character(),
    RECIPIENT_ID = col_character(),
    AMOUNT = col_double()
  )
) %>% 
  clean_names("snake")
```

Every yearly relationship between lobbyists and their principal clients.

```{r read_emp_lob}
