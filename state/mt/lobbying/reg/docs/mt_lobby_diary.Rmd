## Project

The Accountability Project is an effort to cut across data silos and give journalists, policy
professionals, activists, and the public at large a simple way to search across huge volumes of
public data about people and organizations.

Our goal is to standardizing public data on a few key fields by thinking of each dataset row as a
transaction. For each transaction there should be (at least) 3 variables:

1. All **parties** to a transaction
2. The **date** of the transaction
3. The **amount** of money involved

## Objectives

This document describes the process used to complete the following objectives:

1. How many records are in the database?
1. Check for duplicates
1. Check ranges
1. Is there anything blank or missing?
1. Check for consistency issues
1. Create a five-digit ZIP Code called `ZIP5`
1. Create a `YEAR` field from the transaction date
1. Make sure there is data on both parties to a transaction

## Packages

The following packages are needed to collect, manipulate, visualize, analyze, and communicate
these results. The `pacman` package will facilitate their installation and attachment.

The IRW's `campfin` package will also have to be installed from GitHub. This package contains
functions custom made to help facilitate the processing of campaign finance data.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, dfrning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("irworkshop/campfin")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # data manipulation
  lubridate, # datetime strings
  magrittr, # pipe opperators
  janitor, # dataframe clean
  refinr, # cluster and merge
  scales, # format strings
  readxl, # read excel files
  knitr, # knit documents
  glue, # combine strings
  here, # relative storage
  fs # search storage 
)
```

This document should be run as part of the `R_campfin` project, which lives as a sub-directory of
the more general, language-agnostic [`irworkshop/accountability_datacleaning`][01] GitHub
repository.

The `R_campfin` project uses the [RStudio projects][02] feature and should be run as such. The
project also uses the dynamic `here::here()` tool for file paths relative to _your_ machine.

```{r where_here}
# where does this document knit?
here::here()
```

## Data

Data is obtained from the [Montana Commissioner of Political Practices][cpp].

> The Commissioner of Political Practices also makes information about lobbying money in Montana
publicly available. Any member of the public can see who is registered as a lobbyist, who is a
principal (a person or entity that pays lobbyists to lobby on their behalf), and how money is spent
to influence legislation and legislators.
> 
> See a list of registered principals and lobbyists for the 2019 legislative session [here][xlsx]
as an excel doc or [here][pdf] as a PDF.

### Download

The Montana Commissioner of Political Practices makes lobbying registration data available through 

```{r create_raw_dir}
raw_dir <- here("mt", "lobbying", "reg", "data", "raw")
dir_create(raw_dir)
```

```{r download_raw}

raw_urls <- glue("https://app.mt.gov/cgi-bin/camptrack/lobbysearch/lobbySearch.cgi?ACTION=LOBBYDOWNLOAD&SESSION={seq(2010,2020, by = 2)}&Download+File=Download+File")

dest_file = glue("{raw_dir}/mtlr_{seq(2010,2020, by = 2)}.zip")

if (!all_files_new(raw_dir)) {
    download.file(
      url = raw_urls,
      destfile = dest_file)
}
```
Before we unzip the file, we can view it's contents.

```{r list_key}
zip_content <- as_tibble(
  .name_repair = make_clean_names,
  x = unzip(
    zipfile = dest_file,
    list = TRUE
  )
)

dir_ls(raw_dir, glob = "*.zip") %>% 
  map_dfr(unzip,list = TRUE) %>% 
  clean_names()

dir_ls(raw_dir, glob = "*.zip") %>% map(unzip,
    exdir = raw_dir)

# wget <- function(url, dir) {
#   system2(
#     command = "wget",
#     args = c(
#       "--no-verbose", 
#       "--content-disposition", 
#       url, 
#       paste("-P", raw_dir)
#     )
#   )
# }
# 
# if (!all_files_new(raw_dir)) {
#   map(raw_urls, wget, raw_dir)
# }
# 
# raw_paths <- dir_ls(raw_dir)
```

### Read

Using the `readxl::read_excel()` function, we can import this file as a dataframe.

```{r read_raw}
mtlr <- vroom(
  file = dir_ls(raw_dir, glob = "*.csv"),
  delim = ",",
  col_names = TRUE,
  na = "",
  quote = "\"",
  escape_double = TRUE,
  .name_repair = make_clean_names,
  col_types = cols(
  )
)
```

## Pivot

However, the file is in _wide_ format, with rows representing clients and multiple columns
containing the lobbyists for that client. Using `tidyr::pivot_longer()`, we can pivot this wide
format to a long format, with one row per client/lobbyist relationship.

```{r pivot_longer}
mtlr <- mtlr %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Lobbyist"),
    values_to = "Lobbyist Name",
    names_to = c("Type", "Number"),
    names_sep = " ",
    names_ptypes = list(
      "Type" = character(), 
      "Number" = numeric()
    )
  ) %>% 
  clean_names("snake") %>% 
  remove_empty("cols") %>% 
  drop_na(lobbyist_name)
```

```{r rename}
names(mtlr)[2:3] %>% 
  str_extract( "(.*)_report") %>% 
  str_remove_all("\\d") %>% 
  str_remove_all("_._") -> names(mtlr)[2:3]
```

## Explore

```{r glimpse}
head(mtlr)
tail(mtlr)
glimpse(sample_frac(mtlr))
```
